Changes made in 
The energy and exergy of light
Heun et al.

* p. 2: "Figures 1 and 5" --> "Figure 1 and others" (to eliminate the figure reference order problem)

* last line of p. 2: "forlater"" --> "for later"" (added space)

* p. 5: The sentence "Note that the overdo notation ... exergy flow." should NOT be removed. 
That sentence was inserted in response to reviewer comments. 
See .tex file for details.

* p. 7: "See Benenson et al. [40])" --> "(See Benenson et al. [40])"  (Added opening parentheses, as requested.)

* p. 9:  "(p. 172)who state"" --> "(p. 172) who state"" (added space)

* p. 12: "(See Figure 5.)" --> "(See Section 3.)"  (Addresses comment "mdpi:Figure 5 and its first mention crossed the first level title, please change position of it."  Rather than move the figure, which would be inappropriate, we decided to change the reference.)

* p. 18 and 19:  The question was asked whether the headings 

  - Estimating the average exergy-to-energy ratio

  - Estimating the average photopic-to-universal conversion factor

  - Implementing the approximate method

can be changed to a 4th level section.
In fact, that is our intent.
At present, these headings are coded as \{paragraph}, 
which is a 4th-level section, according to https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Sections_and_chapters
We're not sure how to make this change ourselves, 
so the editor or typesetter should feel free to make the change.

* p. 20:  We confirm that supplementary materials will be available online.  
In fact, the repository at https://doi.org/10.5518/865 is ready to go.
The only missing piece is the DOI of the paper.
As soon as we get the DOI of the paper, 
we will flip the switch to make the supplementary materials available.

p. 21:  Your changes to the nomenclature table are acceptable,
provided that the sentence

"Note that the overdo notation ... exergy flow."

remains on p. 5.  
(See above.)

* p. 22, reference 8: Fixed publisher name ("Pearson Higher" --> "Pearson"), author list (added Reese), title ("Biology" --> "Campbell Biology").  See https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7RPDQQ/ref=rdr_kindle_ext_tmb for details.  Added city (New York).

* p. 22
