Artificial lighting provides an indispensable energy service (illumination) for modern life. 
The field of societal exergy analysis considers light (and many other energy products)
to be enablers of economic growth, and 
lighting contributes a small, but non-negligible fraction of total useful exergy
input to modern economies.
In societal exergy analyses, 
the exergetic efficiency of lamps has been approximated by an energy efficiency, 
resulting in much confusion to date. 
In response, 
we use recent results from the photometry and thermodynamics of radiation literatures to
develop a new, exact method for calculating the exergy of light and the exergetic efficiency of lamps.
The exact method 
(a)~is free of (possibly erroneous) assumptions for the maximum luminous efficacy, 
(b)~uses the correct spectral exergy-to-energy ratio, no longer assuming its value to be 1, and
(c)~allows choices for the spectral weighting function.
The exact method exposes assumptions inherent to the original method and 
leads to a better approximation of lamp exergetic efficiency, when needed.
To conclude, we provide two recommendations 
for societal exergy analysts:
(a)~use the new, exact method and the universal luminosity weighting function 
    when lamp spectral power distribution data are available and
(b)~use a reasonable approximation to the exact method when only lamp luminous efficacy data are available.

% \textbf{(Broad context and the problem)}

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Broad context and the problem}
\label{sec:broad_context}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Artificial light provides an indispensable energy service (illumination), 
enabling activities at times when natural light levels are insufficient.
Artificial illumination is so valuable that around 20~\% of global grid-connected electricity 
is consumed for the purpose of making light~\cite{waide2006}.
With the modern breakthrough technology of light emitting diode (LED) lamps,
which now comprise 40~\% of residential lamp sales~\cite{IEA2019},
applications have spread beyond illumination to many other fields
including human physiology and photosynthesis for horticulture~\cite{Pattison2018LEDefficacy}.
The use and analysis of the energy and exergy efficiency of lighting is applied to a range of fields,
including energy economics~\cite{Nordhaus1996},
societal exergy analysis~\cite{Ayres2005},
energy history~\cite{Fouquet:2006},
and forecasting energy efficiency improvements~\cite{IEA2019}.
However, a key problem arises for the energy analyst:
there are differing concepts and definitions of lighting efficiency.
These differences matter on two counts.
First, with the rise of LED lamps,
the proximity to the efficiency limits of lighting appears within reach – but what is the limit?
Second, given the expanding role that artificial lighting plays globally,
understanding precisely 
its potential contribution---via increasing efficiency---to reducing energy use
to meet carbon dioxide emission targets is crucially important.
The aim of this paper is therefore to bring clarity to the analyst 
on the definitions of the energy and exergy conversion efficiency 
of artificial light for illumination.
Our application is societal exergy analysis, and 
we exclude non-illumination purposes, such as horticulture and heating.

\subsection{Lighting fundamentals}
\label{sec:lighting_fundamentals}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the outset, we define two fundamental aspects of lighting,
with more detail coming in **** Sections X and Y ***.
The first fundamental aspect of lighting is a clear definition of what we mean by \emph{light}.
Light is useful energy in the form of 
electromagnetic (EM) radiation. 
Light energy is quantified in terms of 
energy~($E$),
wavelength~($\lambda$), and
frequency~($\nu$), 
all related by Planck's equation:
%
\begin{equation}
  E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $c$ is the speed of light (in m/s).
**** PB: Add example units in preceding senetence. Is E in J or J/s? ---MKH ****
EM radiation within the range \humaneyesensitivity{} is considered ``light''~\cite{campbell2017}, because
the human retina responds only within these wavelengths,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph}.

@

The second fundamental aspect of light is that 
modern lighting is provided by energy conversion through three stages
of the energy conversion chain:
primary energy (e.g., coal), which is then converted to
final energy (i.e., electricity, measured in watts), and last to
useful energy output (i.e., the provision of visible light energy, measured in lumens).
The efficiency of energy conversion~($\eta$) from the final stage (electricity) 
to the useful stage (light) is the focus of this paper.
We note that both human perception and satisfaction of human needs
are an energy service (illumination),
which occurs after the useful stage.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Diverging approaches to lighting efficiency}
\label{sec:divergent_approaches}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**** Section~\ref{sec:divergent_approaches} feels a bit like Section~\ref{sec:further_challenges}.
We need to synchronize the two sections.
Furthermore, any issues raised here should be addressed clearly below. 
Sorting out this issue is mine.
For now, PB should do the edits that I suggest.---MKH ****

From this point, however, we stumble into sources of confusion surrounding 
the energy conversion efficiency ($\eta$) of lamps.
A conventional way to quantify conversion efficiency
is luminous efficacy (in lumens/watt, or lm/W),
which is luminous power (light output, in lm)
per electrical energy input (in W).
The first source of confusion is that some practitioners
equate luminous efficacy with luminous (or light) efficiency.
For example, \citet{Nordhaus1996} provides estimates of historical lighting efficiencies
from the earliest time of open wood fires (0.002~lm/W),
through to candles (0.1~lm/W),
tungsten filament lamps (10~lm/W) and
compact fluorescent light bulbs (68~lm/W).
\citet[p.~265]{Tsao2010appetitelight} are very clear,
but wrong, when they state
``[l]uminous efficacy represents the efficiency with which energy is used to produce visible light.''
Luminous efficacy is commonly taken to be a proxy
for energy efficiency, but they are not equivalent.
**** Why?  Need to explain.
Can we be more specific?  Luminous efficacy is a final-energy-to-service 
efficiency, not an energy efficiency? 
Or something similar? ---MKH ****
**** I propose the following " ...but they are not equivalent, as the lumen is not a measure of the total visible light emitted by a lamp, as further discussed in section 2.1.3. ---ZM ****

Others (***REF***) more correctly define efficiency of light provision on a thermodynamic basis, namely the \emph{luminous efficiency},as follows:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_eqn}
  \eta = \frac{\text{actual lamp efficacy [lm/W]}}{\text{theoretical maximum efficacy limit [lm/W]}} \; .
\end{equation}

**** It will not be clear to the reader why Equation~\ref{eq:eta_eqn} is more correct
than luminous efficacy. We need to spell it out. ---MKH ****

**** I'm not sure whether this equation is inherently more correct. I think we should change this to "Others calculate the efficiency of a lamp, positing it to be the final to useful exergy efficiency, by taking the quotient of a lamps luminous efficacy and the maximum luminous efficacy as follows. This approach is discussed further in section 2.2.1 ---ZM ****


However, Equation~\ref{eq:eta_eqn} takes us straight into two further sources of confusion:
the numerator and the denominator.
The confusion of the numerator, 
as set out by \citet{Paoli2020},
is how to quantify actual lamp efficacy. 
Should one use quantify lamp output by 
omni-directional or 
directional (aimed at the point of illumination) lumens?
Should one measure electricity at the wall plug or at the lamp itself?

The other, and perhaps more controversial, source of confusion
is the denominator: 
\emph{what is the theoretical maximum efficacy limit} (in lm/W)?
Within the literature, three common values are adopted:
220~lm/W \cite[Table~5.6.9]{Ayres2003, USDepartmentofEnergyDoE2011},
400~lm/W \cite{Ayres2005, Tsao2010solidstate, Summers1971, Guevara2016}, and
683~lm/W \cite{Kondo2009, Serrenho2014}, based on the maximum efficacy of a ???, white light, and light at 555nm respectively.

Even within technical lighting papers,
there is divergence over the theoretical maximum efficacy limit of lamps,
due to differing decisions of what ``luminosity function'' to adopt,
as the eye is differentially sensitive wavelengths within the visible range (\humaneyesensitivity{}).
Such differences are still very recent
\cite{Delgado-Bonal:2017aa, Pattison2018LEDphotons, Rea2018, Royer2016}.
**** Preceding sentence probably doesn't say what you want it to say.
Do you mean, ``such differences remain contentious?'' ---MKH ***
With the introduction of high-efficiency LED lamps, which
are tunable to maximize output at different visible wavelengths,
the issue of differential sensitivity of the human eye has urgency,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LuminousEfficacy_Graph}.
**** I don't think that Figure~\ref{fig:LuminousEfficacy_Graph}
demonstrates the issue of differential eye sensitivity.
I think Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph} shows differential eye sensitivity. ---MKH ****

\subsection{Exergy theory}
\label{sec:framework}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Energy and exergy are two methods to quantify the physical property that,
when transferred to an object,
changes its temperature or performs work on it.
(For this discussion, we can't call the ``physical property'' energy, exergy, work, or heat,
because these concepts need to remain separated. 
So, we use the generic term ``physical property.'')
We discuss energy and exergy quantifications of the physical property in the sections below, 
beginning with heat and work, 
the concepts for which \enaex{} originated.
Thereafter, we develop a framework for the \enaex{} of light
in a parallel manner to the \enaex{} of heat and work.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Enaex{} ($\dot{E}$ and $\dot{X}$) of heat and work} 
\label{sec:energy_and_exergy_of_heat_and_work}
%------------------------------

Energy quantifies the physical property by its heat content.
Thus, heat (the ability to influence temperature) is pure energy.
Thanks to Thompson's cannon experiment~\cite{Thompson:1798aa}, 
we know that work can be converted, without loss, into heat.

Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} shows a heat engine that converts 
heat at $1$ to 
work at $3$
with a waste heat byproduct at $2$. 
All streams can be counted as energy ($\dot{E}$), such that 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:all_streams_energy}
  \dot{E}_1 = \dot{Q}_1, \; \dot{E}_2 = \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; \dot{E}_3 = \dot{W}_3 \; .
\end{equation}

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A heat engine that uses heat (1) to produce heat (2) and work (3).}
\label{fig:heat_engine}
\end{figure}

Energy efficiency is defined as $\eta_E \equiv \frac{\text{energy out}}{\text{energy in}}$.
For the example of Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_efficiency}
  \eta_E = \frac{\dot{E}_2 + \dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 + \dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1} = 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
because the first law of thermodynamics 
states that energy is conserved ($\dot{Q}_1 = \dot{Q}_2 + \dot{W}_3$).

That said, typically only one of the products in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} 
is deemed valuable: the work produced by the heat engine ($\dot{W}_3$).
Thus, the \emph{valuable} energy efficiency ($\eta_{E,v}$) is 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:valuable_energy_efficiency}
  \eta_{E,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1} < 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Heat (the ability to influence temperature) is 
only one possible outcome of transferring the physical quantity
from one object to another.
Heat is certainly valuable to humans, but so is another quantity: 
work, the ability to exert a force on another object.
Exergy quantifies the physical property by its work potential
and provides the answer to the question
``what is the maximum work we could obtain from a stream of this physical property?''
Thus, work is pure exergy.

The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics 
states that heat cannot be converted to work without loss. 
To find the maximum possible work that can be created from heat 
(and, therefore, the exergy of heat), 
we consider the Carnot heat engine which operates at the maximum possible valuable energy efficiency~($\eta_C$), 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_C}
  \eta_C = 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{sys}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $T_0$ is the ambient temperature and $T_{sys}$ is a heat temperature 
($T_1$ or $T_2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}).
The exergy of each stream in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} is then
%
\begin{align}
  \dot{X}_1 &= \phi_1 \dot{Q}_1 = \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) \dot{Q}_1, \\
  \dot{X}_2 &= \phi_2 \dot{Q}_2 = \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \\
  \dot{X}_3 &= \cancelto{1}{\phi_3} \dot{W}_3 = \dot{W}_3 \; .
\end{align}
%
In this context, the Carnot efficiency~($\eta_C$) becomes the exergy-to-energy ratio
for heat streams ($\phi_Q = \eta_C$).
The exergy-to-energy ratio for work is $\phi_3 = \phi_W = 1$, 
because work is pure exergy.

Exergy efficiency is defined as $\eta_X \equiv \frac{\text{exergy out}}{\text{exergy in}}$.
For the heat engine in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:exergy_efficiency}
  \eta_X = \frac{\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right)  + \dot{W}_3}
                {\dot{Q}_1 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) } < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
because the second law of thermodynamics 
states that exergy is always destroyed ($\dot{X}_1 > \dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3$ or 
$\dot{X}_D = \dot{X}_1 - (\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3)$).

Assuming, again, that work is valuable gives
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:valuable_exergy_efficiency}
  \eta_{X,v} = \frac{\dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) } < \eta_X < 1\; .
\end{equation}

Note that both $\eta_{E,v}$ and $\eta_{X,v}$ 
are independent of human presence.
The work created by the heat engine~($\dot{W}_3$) could be 
a spinning driveshaft on an automobile carrying four passengers down the freeway or
the same spinning driveshaft on a dynamometer in an unoccupied laboratory.
Both
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the \enaex{} of the work and heat at statepoints 2 and 3 and
  
  \item the \enaex{} efficiencies of the heat engine ($\eta_{E,v}$ and $\eta_{X,v}$)
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
would be the same, regardless.
In other words, both 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the \enaex{} of work and heat and
  
  \item the efficiencies of the heat engine
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
are independent of human presence and the energy service provided by the heat engine.

We now turn 
from the production of work by a heat engine
to the production of light by a lamp.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Enaex{} ($\dot{E}$ and $\dot{X}$) of light} 
\label{sec:energy_and_exergy_of_light}
%------------------------------

Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} replaces the heat engine with a lamp 
that produces broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM,3}$)
instead of work~($\dot{W}_3$).
Electricity powers the lamp at 1, and,
like Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine},
waste heat (conduction and convection only) is produced at 2.

\caption{A lamp that uses electricity~(1) to produce
         heat~(2), broad-spectrum EM radiation~(3), 
         non-light EM radiation~(4), and light~(5).}
\label{fig:lamp}
\end{figure}

Both electricity and EM radiation can be converted to heat without loss, so they are pure energy.
Thus,
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{E}_1 = \dot{W}_{elect,1}, \; \dot{E}_2 = \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; \dot{E}_3 = \dot{E}_{EM,3} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot{E}_{EM,3}$ is the radiant power of broad-spectrum EM radiation
emitted by the lamp in units of energy per unit time.
(When exergy is not involved, the photometry literature often denotes
radiant power by $\Phi$, not $\dot{E}$.
Here, we differentiate between 
the energy rate of broad spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$) and
the exergy rate of broad spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{X}_{EM}$),
reserving $\Phi$ for lumen output of a lamp in Section~\ref{sec:weighting_functions}.)

The lamp's energy efficiency of producing broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\eta_{E,EM}$) is 
%
\begin{equation}  
  \eta_{E,EM} = \frac{\dot{E}_2 + \dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 + \dot{E}_{EM,3}}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} = 1 \; .
\end{equation}
%
The valuable energy efficiency of the lamp
in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}~($\eta_{E,EM,v}$, also called the wall plug efficiency)
is
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_E_v}
  \eta_{E,EM,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{E}_{EM,3}}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
assuming that broad-spectrum EM radiation at 3 is the valuable output from the lamp.

Because electricity can be converted to work without loss in a frictionless motor,
electricity is considered pure exergy, i.e., $\phi_{elect} = 1$.
Thus, the exergy of the first three streams in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{X}_1 = \cancelto{1}{\phi_{elect}} \dot{W}_{elect,1} = \dot{W}_{elect,1}, \; 
              \dot{X}_2 = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; 
              \dot{X}_3 = \phi_{\EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where the term $\phi_{EM}$ is the exergy-to-energy ratio for broad-spectrum EM radiation. 
(See Section~\ref{sec:phi_light} for details.)

In general, the radiant power of a lamp is a spectral quantity,
meaning that it varies with wavelength.
Spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$)
is the EM emissive power available at any wavelength
and is related~\citep{benenson2006handbook} to radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM}$) by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:emissive_power}
  \dot{E}_{EM} = \int \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}
%
Visually, $\dot{E}_{EM}$ is the area under the $\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ vs.\ $\lambda$ curve.

The exergetic efficiency of EM radiation emitted by the lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{X,EM} = \frac{\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} 
          = \frac{\left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2 + \phi_{EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} }{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
In general, $\phi_{EM}$ is also a spectral quantity.
(See Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}.)
The valuable exergetic efficiency of the EM radiation emitted by the lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_X_v}
  \eta_{X,EM,v} = \frac{\dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} 
              = \frac{\phi_{EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} }{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < \eta_{X,EM} < 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Note that the efficiencies are independent of human presence;
$\eta_{X,EM}$ and $\eta_{X,EM,v}$ would be the same, 
whether the lamp is illuminating
an unoccupied room or a crowded bar, 
whether the illumination stimulates the rods and cones of a human eye or
excites band gap electrons in an amorphous silicon solar cell.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Human perception of EM radiation and light} 
\label{sec:human_perception_of_EM_radiation}
%------------------------------

We noted above that both
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item \enaex{} of broad-spectrum EM radiation and

  \item \enaex{} efficiency of lamps

\end{enumerate*}
%
are independent of human presence.
But what about human \emph{perception}?

Human beings perceive heat by temperature and light by wavelength.
Human skin can perceive the thermal radiation portion of the broader electromagnetic spectrum,
approximately 100 nm < $\lambda$ < 10,000 nm. 
Furthermore, human skin is differentially sensitive to EM spectrum wavelength.  
Indeed, thermoreceptors in the dermis of skin are important sensors for regulation of body temperature.
****
Need a reference here.---MKH
****
Similarly, human eyes perceive only a (narrower) portion of the EM radiation emitted by lamps
(approximately \humaneyesensitivity).
To quantify light energy (and exergy), 
we must move from broad-spectrum EM
energy and exergy~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to light~($\dot{E}_{L}$ and $\dot{X}_{L}$). 
But how?

Knowing that visual perception of light is a function of wavelength
leads to modifying Equation~\ref{eq:emissive_power}
to include a spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$) such that
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:weighted_emissive_power}
  \dot{E}_L = \int \dot{E}_{L,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda = \int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
with $0 \le f_\lambda \le 1$
and $\dot{E}_{L,\lambda} = f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$.

In Equation~\ref{eq:weighted_emissive_power}, 
the spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$) converts 
from broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to light~($\dot{E}_{L}$ and $\dot{X}_{L}$), 
the valuable part of EM radiation for illumination.
In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_dot_5}
  \dot{E}_{L,5} = \int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

In Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, any EM radiation at statepoint 3 
\emph{not} converted to light
is quantified as non-light EM radiation at statepoint 4~($\dot{E}_{N,4}$).
Specifically,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N_dot_5}
  \dot{E}_{N,4} = \int (1 - f_\lambda) \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{The exergy-to-energy ratio of EM radiation ($\phi_{\EM}$)}
\label{sec:phi_light}
%------------------------------

Recent advances in the thermodynamics of radiation community
enable converting the energy of EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$)
into the exergy of EM radiation~($\dot{X}_{EM}$).
The exergy-to-energy ratio of EM radiation
($\phi_{\EM}$, called the ``radiative exergy-energy coefficient'' in that community)
is given by Petela's Equation~\cite{petela1964exergy}:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:petelas_equation}
 \phi_{\EM} = 1 - \frac{4}{3}\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}} + \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\right)^4 \; .
\end{equation}

However, Petela's equation assumes a blackbody emitter and
a blackbody absorber 
at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_0$, respectively.
To determine $\phi_{\EM}$ for a non-blackbody lamp,
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio ($\phi_{\EM,\lambda}$),
must be calculated.
An effective temperature of light photons~\cite{chen2008} ($T_\lambda$) 
provides the link between Petela's equation (Equation~\ref{eq:petelas_equation})
and the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{\EM,\lambda}$).

Petela's equation has recently been verified via an infinite-staged
Carnot heat engine model \cite{zhou2017exergy}
that is powered by radiative energy transfer.
In the radiative Carnot model, a photon possessing a characteristic frequency 
and photon effective temperature enters a medium that acts as an ideal absorber. 
The photon transfers an infinitesimal quantity of energy to the absorber via thermal radiation.
The energy enters an infinitesimally small Carnot heat engine and performs work. 
The absorber then emits another photon at lower energy and frequency,
and therefore lower photon effective temperature. 
This process repeats until the frequency of the photon equals zero
and the photon effective temperature ($T_\lambda$)~\cite{Shan2019}
equals the reference temperature ($T_0$).

We note that the use of the photon effective temperature approach has been criticized by 
\citeauthor{liu2009},
who argued that it is inappropriate
``to endue a single photon with macro-scale thermodynamic parameters
such as exergy and entropy''~\citep[p.~1810]{liu2009}.
We acknowledge this critique, 
but we also note that here $T_\lambda$ is ascribed to a stream of photons
traveling from a lamp to an eye.
Thus, for our purposes, $T_\lambda$ can be considered the statistical average effective temperature 
of that stream of photons.
****
Is this a good way to address the critique?---MKH
****
The product of wavelength and photon effective temperature is a constant~($c_3$ in \citet{chen2008}) such that
%
\begin{equation}
  \lambda T_{\lambda} = c_{3} = 5.33016 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m-K} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
or
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_lambda}
  T_\lambda = \frac{5.33016 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m-K}}{\lambda} \; .
\end{equation}

We make the assumption that the mechanism
by which light is converted into electrical nerve signals
in the human eye
is radiative EM energy transfer
from a light source~(1) to an eye~(0).
We assume no losses in radiative transmission
between the lamp and the iris,
i.e., no radiation scattering occurs through air, 
an assumption that holds for short distances typically 
observed in lighting applications (<~10~m).
(See \citet{Shan2019} for a method to estimate transmission losses
over longer distances.)
We further assume that the human iris is a blackbody absorber 
(absorbing all wavelengths of radiation perfectly \cite{benenson2006handbook}), 
being a small aperture on a larger cavity.
(In this assumption, we follow \citet[p.~172]{Rossing2020} who state
``another good example of [a blackbody absorber] is the human eye;
the pupil looks black because most light entering it is trapped and absorbed.'')
Thus, we use Shan and Zhou's~\cite{Shan2019} spectral formulation of Petela's equation,
which replaces the temperature of the emitter ($T_1$) by photon effective temperature~($T_\lambda$):
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_EM_lambda_shan_zhou}
 \phi_{\EM,\lambda} = 1 - \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{T_{0}}{T_{\lambda}} \right)
                        + \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T_{\lambda}}\right)^4 \; .
\end{equation}
%
Further, Equation~\ref{eq:T_lambda} can be substituted into Equation~\ref{eq:phi_EM_lambda_shan_zhou}
(in the form $T_\lambda = c_3 / \lambda$),
and $T_0$ can be taken as 310~K, the temperature of the human body.
The result is an equation for $\phi_{L,\lambda}$, the specular exergy-to-energy ratio of light:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou}
 \phi_{L,\lambda} = 1 
                    - \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{310 \text{ K}}{c_3} \right) \lambda 
                    + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{310 \text{ K}}{c_3} \right)^4 \lambda^4 \; .
\end{equation}

The exergy of light emitted by a non-blackbody lamp~($\dot{X}_L$)
is found by integrating the product of
the spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$),
a spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$), and
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$)
with respect to wavelength.
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_dot_L}
  \dot{X}_L = \int \phi_{L,\lambda} \, f_\lambda \, \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda
\end{equation}

The quotient of $\dot{X}_L$ and $\dot{E}_L$ gives 
the exergy-energy ratio of light~($\phi_{L}$), 
which is specific to each combination of
weighting function and lamp ($f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$).

\subsubsection{Light efficiency of a lamp} 
\label{sec:light_efficiency}
%------------------------------

If the valuable product of a lamp is considered to be its light~($\dot{E}_L$ or $\dot{X}_L$)
as opposed to its broadband EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ or $\dot{X}_{EM}$),
Equations~\ref{eq:eta_E_v} and~\ref{eq:eta_X_v} require modification.
In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, the valuable energy efficiency of light becomes
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_E_v_light}
  \eta_{E,L,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_5}{\dot{E}_{elect,1}} 
               = \frac{\int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
and the valuable exergetic efficiency of light becomes
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_X_v_light}
  \eta_{X,L,v} = \frac{\dot{X}_5}{\dot{X}_{elect,1}} 
               = \frac{\int \phi_{L,\lambda} f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Weighting functions}
\label{sec:weighting_functions}
%------------------------------

Spectral weighting functions ($f_\lambda$) convert 
radiant power ($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to light ($\dot{E}_L$ and $\dot{X}_L$).
(See Section~\ref{sec:human_perception_of_EM_radiation}.)
We use four spectral weighting functions relevant to illumination
to enable example calculations.
(See Section~\ref{sec:results}.)

The first weighting function option is degenerate: 
the analyst could decide to ignore the nuances of human visual perception altogether,
implicitly assuming that all EM radiation emitted from a lamp is light, 
whether or not it is within the visible portion of the EM spectrum.
For the first option, the degenerate (unweighted, uw) weighting function ($f_{\lambda,uw}$) is
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f1}
  f_{\lambda,uw} = 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Second, the analyst could 
deem a lamp's EM radiation to be useful if and only if it \emph{could}
stimulate photoreceptive cells in the human eye,
regardless of the spectral sensitivity of those cells.
In the second option, the analyst excludes wavelengths outside the range of perception by the human eye
when determining the \enoex{} of light.
For the second option (visible, vis),
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f2}
f_{\lambda,vis} =
  \begin{cases}
    0 \; , & \text{for } \lambda < 380 \text{ nm} \\
    1 \; , & \text{for } 380 \text{ nm} \le \lambda \le 750 \text{ nm} \\
    0 \; , & \text{for } 750 \text{ nm} < \lambda \\
  \end{cases} \; .
\end{equation}

But the human eye is spectrally sensitive to EM radiation, 
with peak sensitivity at 555~nm (green)
and lesser sensitivities at both longer (redder) and shorter (bluer) wavelengths.
A third option weights a lamp's emitted EM radiation 
by the photopic sensitivity of the human eye.
The photopic luminosity~(pl) function~($V_\lambda$) describes this sensitivity, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph}.
The photopic luminosity function 
was defined by the Commission Internationale de l' Éclairage (CIE) in 1931
and represents the sensitivity of M and L cones
at daytime light levels \cite{CVRL2008}.
So for Option 3,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f3}
  f_{\lambda,pl} = V_\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:f3} into Equation~\ref{eq:weighted_emissive_power}
yields
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{E}_{L,pl} = \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
which provides the basis for calculating a lamp's output 
of visible light~($\Phi_{pl}$) in the unit of lumens~(lm):
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lumen}
  \Phi_{pl} = (683 \text{ lm/W}) \; \dot{E}_{L,pl} 
            = (683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where 683~lm/W is the luminous efficiency of a perfect light source
emitting exclusively at $\lambda = 555 \text{ nm}$.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph}.) 
(Note that because lumens are a re-scaling of watts, 
lumens are also a unit of radiant power.)

When the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$) is used 
to calculate luminous power, 
the valuable energy efficiency of a lamp can be written in terms of luminous efficacy~($K$)
by modifying Equation~\ref{eq:eta_E_v_light} to be (in the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp})
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lum_effic_def}
  K \equiv \frac{(683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $K$ is in lm/watt.

The photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$) is the industry standard for determining lumen output
of lamps, but it has been criticized for under-representing
the power of wavelengths different from 555~nm. 
In fact, the photopic luminosity function
neglects the differential sensitivity of the human eye's other light receptors,
namely the short-wave cones,
rods, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs),
which are responsible for vision in low-light settings and
physiological functions such as the regulation of circadian rhythms.
Thus, the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$),
and therefore also luminous efficacy~($K$),
are said to have a long-wave bias.

A fourth option (universal, univ) weights 
a lamp's spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$)
by the spectral sensitivity of all five light receptors in the human eye
(not just the M and L cones as does $V_\lambda$). 
The universal luminosity efficiency function ($U_\lambda$) \cite{Rea2018}
captures the actual, broader sensitivity of the human eye.
So for option 4,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f4}
  f_{\lambda,univ} = U_\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

Table~\ref{tab:wfs} summarizes the weighting functions discussed above.

\input{pieces/wfs.tex}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Lamps}
\label{sec:lamps}
%------------------------------

To demonstrate how the spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$)
affects the energy and exergy efficiency of lamps, 
we need both weighting functions (Section~\ref{sec:weighting_functions}) and
example lamps.

We obtained spectral power distributions of the lamps in Table~\ref{tab:lamps} from the 
Light Spectral Power Distribution Database (LSPDD)~\cite{Roby, miguel2017, aube2013}. 
The data in the LSPDD are provided 
in terms of \emph{relative intensity} ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,rel}$) 
as opposed to \emph{absolute intensity} ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$).
Because lamps in the LSPDD are not measured using an integration sphere,
the integral of the spectral power distribution may not match the radiant power of the lamp
reported by the manufacturer.
To ensure that the integral of each lamp's spectral power distribution 
matches its reported radiant power, 
we applied the standard procedure of scaling the spectral power distribution 
by the ratio ($\mu$) of
the radiant power given by the manufacturer~($K \dot{W}_{elect,1}$) and  
the integral of the spectral radiant power taken from the relative intensity data~($\dot{E}_{EM,rel}$).
%
\begin{equation} 
  \mu \equiv \frac{K \dot{W}_{elect,1}}{\dot{E}_{EM,rel}} \; .
\end{equation}

We then applied the scaling factor~($\mu$) to the spectral power distribution data for each lamp, 
yielding a corrected spectral power distribution data~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$) for each lamp 
that matches the manufacturer's reported radiant power. 
%
\begin{equation} 
  \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}  = \mu \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,rel}
\end{equation}

Although the corrected spectral power distribution data were used for all analyses,
we later display (Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps})
normalized spectral power distributions for each lamp,
such that the peak of each spectral power distribution is 1.
This normalizing process allows easy visual comparison 
of lamps with varying electricity consumption 
and spectral power distribution profiles.

We selected one representative lamp for each of four common lamp technologies
(incandescent, INC;
high pressure sodium, HPS;
compact fluorescent, CFL; and
light emitting diode, LED), 
each with a unique spectral power distribution.
See Table~\ref{tab:lamps} for details about lamps discussed throughout this paper.

Results are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps} for 
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio for light~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$), 
spectral weighting functions~($f_\lambda$),
the spectral emissive power of lamps~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$), and
spectral light emitted by lamps~($\dot{E}_{L,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{L,\lambda}$).

The four graphs in the top-right of Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}
show spectral radiant power ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$) as the top of the gray region for each lamp.
Applying Equation~\ref{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou} 
to the four lamps identified in Section~\ref{sec:lamps}
gives spectral radiant power in exergy terms ($\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$),
shown by the dark green line.
The areas of the gray regions ($\dot{E}_{EM}$) are given by Equation~\ref{eq:emissive_power}.
The areas beneath the dark green lines in all graphs are the exergy of light~($\dot{X}_L$), 
given by Equation~\ref{eq:X_dot_L}.

Note that exergy (dark green line) is very close to energy (top of the gray region), because
the exergy-to-energy ratio ($\phi_{L,\lambda}$) is always close to~1 for EM wavelengths relevant to light.
The difference between energy and exergy is greatest in the upper right of the graphs when both

Each rainbow colored region shows the energy content of light (spectral luminous power) and

\subsection{Comparison with previous approach 
            to calculating exergetic efficiency~($\eta_{X,L,v}$) 
            in societal exergy analysis}
\label{sec:compwithSEA}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The method for calculating the exergy of light presented in Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}
differs from the previous approach used in the societal exergy analysis community.
This section
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item characterizes the previous approach to calculating the exergy of light
        as an approximate method and 
        characterizes the new method for calculating the exergy of light presented in Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}
        as an exact method and
  
  \item evaluates the approximate method relative to the exact method 
        to obtain three implications for societal exergy analysis.
    
\end{enumerate*}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Approximate and exact methods} 
\label{sec:previous_approach}
%------------------------------

In societal exergy analysis, exergy calculations are sometimes hampered when 
``the useful output cannot or is not typically measured in energy units''
\cite[p.~17]{Sousa2017}. 
In these circumstances, researchers in societal exergy analysis approximate
exergetic efficiency by the quotient of
the minimum energy required to produce a given output and
the actual energy required to produce the same given output.
(See Section~\ref{sec:divergent_approaches}.)
This approximate method has been recommended
for lighting, sound, and information~\cite[p.~17]{Sousa2017}.

For lighting,
the approximate method involves the quotient of
the theoretical minimum rate of energy required to emit one lumen and
the actual rate of energy used to emit one lumen 
for a given lamp, where
the minimum and actual energy rates are obtained 
by taking the inverses of luminous efficacy~($K$).
For a lamp, the quotient is between the lamp's luminous efficacy~($K$)
and the maximum luminous efficacy~($K_{max}$).
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:K_over_e_max}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{\; \; \frac{1}{K_{max}} \; \; }{\frac{1}{K}}
       = \frac{K}{K_{max}} \; .
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:lum_effic_def} shows that 
the luminous efficacy of a lamp~($K$) is equal to the quotient
of the luminous power ($\Phi_{pl}$, Equation~\ref{eq:lumen}), expressed in lumens, and
the electricity consumption rate of the device
($\dot{W}_{elect,1}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}).
Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:lum_effic_def} into Equation~\ref{eq:K_over_e_max} gives
(with reference to Figure~\ref{fig:lamp})
exergetic efficiency for the approximate method:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{ \; \; \frac{(683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; \;}{K_{max}} \; .
\end{equation}


With recent advances in photometry (Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}),
it is now possible to determine the energy and exergy of light exactly, 
thereby relieving societal exergy analysts
of the need to approximate exergetic efficiency
by the quotient of
the minimum energy required to produce a lumen and
the actual energy required to produce a lumen.
Thus, we can evaluate the approximate method in light of recent advances, 
using exergetic efficiency as the point of comparison.

Comparing Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light} (the approximate method)
to Equation~\ref{eq:eta_X_v_light} (the exact method)
reveals that the approximate method for calculating the exergetic efficiency of lighting
is correct only under the following conditions:
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$) is assumed to be 683~lm/W, and 

  \item $\phi_{L,\lambda} = 1$ for all wavelengths,

  \item the spectral weighting function is taken to be the photopic luminosity function ($f_\lambda = V_\lambda$).

\end{enumerate}

As can be seen by comparing the luminous efficiency row of Table~\ref{tab:lamps} 
and the photopic luminosity row of Table~\ref{tab:results_etas},
final-to-useful efficiencies calculated using the photopic luminosity function~($\eta_{E,v,pl}$, Equation \ref{eq:eta_E_v_light} (with $f_\lambda = V_\lambda$)
are equivalent to luminous efficiency values
~(Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light}) 
when maximum luminous efficacy~($K_{max}$) is taken to be 683~lm/W.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Implications for societal exergy analysis} 
\label{sec:implications_for_sea}
%------------------------------

The above comparison between the previous approximate method (Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach}) and
the new exact method of Section~\ref{sec:light_efficiency}
raises three implications for societal exergy analysis.

First, with the previous approximate method, 
the analyst was required to select a value for maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$), 
the denominator of Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light}.
The choice of $K_{max}$ can make a significant difference to the results.
The correct value for $K_{max}$ is 683~lm/W, 
because the approximate method relies upon luminous efficacy of lamps.
Many authors assume $K_{max} = 400 \text{ lm/W}$ 
(e.g., \citet{Ayres2005} and \citet{Guevara2016}),
thereby incorrectly overestimating exergetic efficiency of lighting~($\eta_{X,L,v}$)
by a factor of $\frac{683 \text{ lm/W}}{400 \text{ lm/W}} = 1.71$.

Second, to obtain the correct exergetic efficiency of lighting, 
analysts must reject the assumption of the previous approximate method that $\phi_{L,\lambda} = 1$.
Recent progress in photometry enables this rejection, 
following the methods of Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}.
Specifically, the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio of light ($\phi_{L,\lambda}$)
of Equation~\ref{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou} and Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps} should be used.
We note, however, that $\phi_{L,\lambda}$ is close to~1 for all wavelengths of interest to illumination.
Happily, the previous approximate method was not far wrong to assume $\phi_L = 1$.

Third, in the approximate method, 
the analyst is required to use the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$)
for the specular weighting function~($f_\lambda$).
However, it is not certain that the photopic luminosity function
is the best choice, 
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:blue_light} below.

In summary, the exact method provides the following benefits over the approximate method:
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item it uses the correct spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$), no longer assuming its value to be~1;

  \item it is free of (possibly erroneous) assumptions for the maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$); and 
  
  \item it allows choices for the spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$), 
        no longer requiring $f_\lambda = V_\lambda$, 
        thereby enabling analyses suited precisely to each application of EM radiation
        (illumination, human physiology, photosynthesis for horticulture, etc.).

\end{enumerate}

****
By how much would SEA results change if we adopt this new methodology?
I.e. how wrong were former studies and how critical is it to improve the methodology?---EAR
****

****
How wrong previous studies were depends on what we feel the correct approach to be. 
I think we should decide this as a group, and then we can quantify the difference! ---ZM

\subsection{Weighting functions and blue light}
\label{sec:blue_light}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**** Should we change this section to 'Rationale underpinning the selection of our recommended luminosity/weighting function with a subsubsection for blue light? ---ZM ****


It is known that short wavelength EM radiation (bluer light)
provides physiological benefits, such as
the suppression of melanopsin and 
the regulation of circadian rhythms~\citep{Pattison2018LEDphotons}.
To obtain the benefits of blue light, 
many lamps are designed with a blue spike 
in the region of 480~nm, 
the peak of the melanopsin suppression action spectrum \cite{lucas2014}.
The blue spike can be seen from the spectral power distribution~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$)
for the LED lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}. 

Manufacturers who design lamps with blue spikes
do not get credit for their efforts, because 
the industry-standard measure of lighting efficiency,
luminous efficacy~($K$), 
uses the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$), 
which under-represents power at short wavelengths.
This state of affairs biases lighting manufacturers to reduce short wavelength
output of lamps, even when short wavelength EM radiation would 
provide physiological benefits.

To more accurately represent the utility of all wavelengths of light,
the universal luminosity function~($U_\lambda$) has been proposed 
as a replacement for the photopic luminosity function ($V_\lambda$), because it 
accounts for the sensitivity of all five types of light receptors in the human eye,
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:human_perception_of_EM_radiation}.

Previously, 
societal exergy analysis implicitly adopted the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$)
when it utilized the approximate method for calculating the exergetic efficiency of lighting.
(See Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach}.)
Thus, societal exergy analysis has, in the past, also under-represented 
the physiological benefits of blue light.

The choice of weighting function ($f_\lambda$) in societal exergy analysis
should be appropriate for the application of each lamp.

As demonstrated by Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}, 
which utilises the CIE 10 degree colour matching function 
provided in the \emph{ggspectra} R package \cite{Aphalo2015},
whilst the visible spectrum weighting function
preserves all light within the visible spectrum (\humaneyesensitivity), 
the human eyes perception of light and colour diminishing rapidly after $700nm$.

Therefore, to provide consistency for societal exergy analysis community moving forward,
we propose that societal exergy analysts 
adopt the universal luminosity function ($U_\lambda$) in accordance with \cite{Rea2018},
when the primary purpose of lamps is illumination.

The switch from the photopic luminosity function~($V_\lambda$)
to the universal luminosity function~($U_\lambda$) is made possible 
by the exact method described in Section~\ref{sec:framework}.
However in the absence of spectral power distribution data, 
an approximate method detailed below in Section~\ref{sec:ConversionUniversal}
must be used.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Application for country-level societal exergy analysis}
\label{sec:Application}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsubsection{Aggregate lighting efficiencies}
\label{sec:AggEfficiencies}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To move from the final to useful energy/exergy efficiency of a single lamp, 
to either an economy-wide or sectoral aggregate lighting efficiency, 
several types of data are required for the given period of study:

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item efficiency data for each lamp technology~($\eta_{E,L,v}$ and $\eta_{X,L,v}$),
  \item exergy-to-energy ratios for each of the corresponding lamp technologies~($\phi_L$), and
  \item economy-wide electricity consumption by lamp technology~($\dot{W}_{elect,1}$).

\end{enumerate}

Items (a) and (b) are rarely reported for lamps, 
nor is the associated spectral power distribution~(SPD) data.
Instead, the most common measure of lighting efficiency reported for lamps is the luminous efficacy~($K$).
Therefore, to develop an aggregate measure of lighting efficiency, 
luminous efficacy data must be converted into efficiency values.
As demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach} if the \emph{valuable} light
is deemed to be the radiant power weighted by the photopic luminosity function 
(luminous power, $\Phi_{pl}$),
the final to useful efficiencies are equivalent to the luminous efficiency (Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light}), namely $\frac{K}{683 lm/W}$.
In the absence of SPD data a generalised exergy-to-energy ratio ($\phi_{i,pl}$) 
for each technology type must be selected,
as the shape of lamp spectral power distributions 
display relatively little variation within technology groups
compared to between groups, 
the aggregate exergy to energy ratios for those lamps also display little variation.

**** Shall i calculate phi for several types of the same type to demonstrate this? ---ZM ****

Once efficiency series have been calculated
and exergy to energy ratios obtained for each lamp type,
data for the proportion of each lamp type in use for each year of the study is needed,
i.e. the fleet of lamps, 
and ideally in the form of the economy-wide electricity consumption by lamp technology.
For example, the US DOE's Lighting Market Characterization reports provide such data for the USA,
and for the years 2001~\cite{DOE2002}, 2010~\cite{DOE2012}, and 2015~\cite{DOE2017}, 
along with associated luminous efficacy values, 
and for the following lamp technologies: incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent,
linear fluorescent, high intensity discharge, LED and other.

The aggregate lighting efficiency for a particular year is then given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg_eta}
  \eta_{agg, pl} = \sum \limits_{i \in Lamps} \theta_{i} \cdot \phi_{i,pl} \cdot \eta_{E,i,pl} 
\end{equation}

**** Or do we express Equation~\ref{eq:agg_eta} in terms of $K$? ---ZM ****


\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg_eta_K}
  \eta_{agg, pl} = \sum \limits_{i \in Lamps} \theta_{i} \cdot \phi_{i,pl} \cdot \frac{K_{i}}{683 lm/W}
\end{equation}

Where $\theta_{i}$ denotes the proportion of electricity consumption for lighting
by a particular lamp technology for a given year.

**** Do we provide a demonstration using the DOE data? 
e.g. "for which we provide the concise following example........" ---ZM ****

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsubsection{Conversion to the use of the universal luminosity function}
\label{sec:ConversionUniversal}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Given the likely absence of spectral power distribution data 
for each lamp technology over time, 
an approximate method must be also used to adjust the available 
final to useful energy efficiencies derived from luminous efficacy values, 
which are based on the photopic luminosity function ($V_\lambda$), 
to final to useful efficiencies based on the universal luminosity function ($U_\lambda$).

Similarly to our proposed method of using a generalised exergy-to-energy ratio
for each lamp technology ($\phi_{i,pl}$) (Section~\ref{sec:AggEfficiencies}),
we propose a generalized conversion factor ($\upsilon_{i,univ}$) 
to obtain approximate final to useful efficiencies 
based on the universal luminosity function ($\eta_{E,univ}$)

**** Create xtable with these factors 
and insert above in results if group confirms this approach ---ZM ****

**** How much of this text should be in the methods, and not the discussion? ---ZM ****

Values for $\upsilon_{i,univ}$ are given by taking the quotient of 
the final to useful efficiency of a lamp using the universal luminosity function ($\eta_{i,E,univ}$)
and the same lamp using the photopic luminoisty function ($\eta_{i,E,pl}$).

**** 
Zeke:  Can we move away from $\upsilon$? It looks too much like ``$v$,''
which we use as a subscript to mean ``valuable.''
Maybe $\rho$ or $\gamma$, instead?---MKH
****

\begin{equation} \label{eq:conversionuniversal}
  \upsilon_{i,univ} = \frac{\eta_{E,univ}}{\eta_{E,pl}}
\end{equation}


Including this conversion factor then provides a method for 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg_eta_univ}
  \eta_{agg, univ} = \sum \limits_{i \in Lamps} \theta_{i} \cdot 
                                          \phi_{i,univ} \cdot 
                                          \upsilon_{i,univ} \cdot 
                                          \eta_{E,i,pl} 
\end{equation}

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Further challenges}
\label{sec:further_challenges}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two challenges facing the societal exergy analyst regarding
the exergy of light, namely
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item how to account for waste heat from lamps and
  
  \item how to account for waste light from lamps.

\end{enumerate*}
%
We discuss each challenge in the sections below.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Waste heat from lamps}
\label{sec:waste_heat}
%------------------------------

Every lamp produces waste heat ($\dot{Q}_2$ and $\dot{E}_{N.4}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp})
as it converts electrical energy into light energy. 
In Section~\ref{sec:energy_and_exergy_of_light}
waste heat was deemed the un-valuable product of the lamp.
However, in some circumstances, the waste heat from lamps is, in fact, valuable,
because it displaces energy for space heating,
especially in winter climates.
In summer climates, waste heat from lamps adds to space cooling loads.
For locations where both summer cooling and winter heating are performed,
the winter/summer effects of lamps cancel, to first order.

Some lamps, commonly termed heat lamps, infrared lamps, or infrared heaters are
explicitly designed to produce radiative heat 
(light in the form of near and far infrared radiation) 
and thermal heat
for various purposes, including
space heating, incubator heating, plastic manufacture, 
food preparation, and warming animals in captivity.
When the infrared portion of light emitted as radiative heat is considered useful 
common ceramic infrared heaters have energy efficiencies of 56.7~\% \citep{brown2016}.
The remainder of the energy (43.3~\%) is converted into thermal heat via convection, 
which may or may not be considered useful, because 
convection acts over a shorter distances than radiation.

The societal exergy analyst must decide how to treat waste heat from lamps
when determining the quantity of useful exergy delivered to society.
To our knowledge, societal exergy analysis has, to date,
ignored waste heat from lamps,
implicitly assuming that winter and summer effects cancel.
We contend that the issue deserves further study,
but that is a topic for another paper.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Waste light from lamps}
\label{sec:waste_light}
%------------------------------

In the exact method,
light is considered un-valuable if it is either outside of the range of wavelengths
in a spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$), or
within a wavelength of light for which the radiant power has been reduced as a result of a weighting function.
However, two further losses occur before the valuable light is available for work \citep{CullenPhD}:
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item losses within the luminaire (lamp housing), 
        where a proportion of light never exits the device, and 
   
  \item light which is incident upon surfaces that do not need to be illuminated,
        such as ceilings. 
        
        **** Is that correct? Would one see the ceiling if it is not illuminated? --- EAR ****
        
        **** This loss refers to the fact that objects such as ceilings, the tops of cabinets etc 
        do not need to be illuminated. 
        Or atleast they do not need to be illuminated with equal intensity! ---ZM ****

\end{enumerate}
%
Furthermore, there are three additional inefficiencies, as detailed by \citet{CullenPhD}.
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item Light which is emitted with excessive intensity.
   
  \item Light which is incident upon surfaces which are not the primary purpose of illumination, 
        e.g. the . 
        
        **** Is this the same as (b) in the list above?---MKH ****
        
        **** This is a subtle point from Cullen (2010), 
        I believe he means light which illuminates surfaces which require less illumination 
        than a the main task-area,
        such as a cabinet vs a computer desk.
        So it's a combination of both point b's.
        I need to take a broader look at the literature for this section
        so I will refine these points! ---ZM ****
  
  \item Light which is under-utilized, e.g., through under-occupancy.
       

\end{enumerate}
%

Accounting for all of these potential efficiency savings in a commercial office lighting scenario
\citet{CullenPhD} estimates the upper limit for energy savings to be 95~\%.

**** I need to look at a broader range of literature than Cullen (2010) ---ZM ****

In the context of SEA, and the energy conversion chain, 
these losses occur at the \emph{energy service} stage, 
after the conversion of electricity to radiant power or light. 
As such we deem further analysis of these passive efficiency losses 
beyond the scope of our study.
