Lighting provides an indispensable energy service, illumination. 
The field of societal exergy analysis considers light (and many other energy products)
to be enablers of economic growth, and 
lighting contributes a non-negligible proportion of total useful exergy
supplied to modern economies.
In societal exergy analysis, 
the exergetic efficiency of lamps is central to
determining the exergy contribution of lighting to an economy.
Conventionally, societal exergy analysts estimate the exergetic efficiency of lamps 
by an energy efficiency, 
causing confusion and, sometimes, mistakes.
In response, 
we use recent results from the photometry and thermodynamics of radiation literatures to
develop an exact method for calculating 
the exergy of light and the exergetic efficiency of lamps.
The exact method 
(a)~is free of any assumptions for the value of the maximum luminous efficacy, 
(b)~uses the correct spectral exergy-to-energy ratio, and 
(c)~allows choices for the spectral luminous weighting function, 
which converts broad-spectrum electromagnetic radiation to light.
The exact method exposes shortcomings inherent to the conventional method and 
leads to a reasonable approximation of lamp exergetic efficiency, when needed.
To conclude, we provide three recommendations 
for societal exergy analysts:
(a)~use the exact method when a lamp's spectral power distribution is available, 
(b)~use the universal luminous weighting function, and
(c)~use the reasonable approximation to the exact method 
    when luminous efficacy is known
    but the spectral power distribution is unavailable.

\subsection{The importance of light and the issue of lighting efficiency}
\label{sec:lighting_importance}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Artificial light provides an indispensable energy service (illumination), 
enabling activities at times when natural light levels are insufficient.
Artificial illumination is so valuable that around 20~\% of global grid-connected electricity 
is consumed for the purpose of making light~\cite{waide2006}.
With the breakthrough technology of light emitting diode (LED) lamps,
which now comprise 40~\% of residential lamp sales~\cite{IEA2019},
applications of artificial lighting have spread beyond illumination to many other fields
including human physiology and photosynthesis for horticulture~\cite{Pattison2018LEDefficacy}.
Given the expanding role that artificial lighting plays globally,
understanding precisely 
its potential contribution---via increasing efficiency---to reducing energy use
to meet carbon dioxide emission targets is crucially important.
Thus, the analysis of the energy and exergetic efficiency of lighting 
is important in many fields, including
energy history~\cite{Fouquet:2006},
energy economics~\cite{Nordhaus1996},
ecological economics~\cite{whiting2020illumination},
forecasting energy efficiency improvements~\cite{IEA2019}, and 
societal exergy analysis~\cite{Ayres2005},
the focus of this article.

\subsection{Lighting fundamentals: Light energy and the energy conversion chain}
\label{sec:light_ECC}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ahead of a detailed treatment of the thermodynamics of light in Section~\ref{sec:framework}
we set out here two fundamental aspects of lighting. 
The first aspect is clear definitions of electromagnetic~(EM) energy and light.
EM energy~($E_{EM}$, in J) is broad-spectrum EM radiation
quantified by the energy of photons via Einstein's equation,
%
\begin{equation}
  E_{EM} = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where 
$h$ is Planck's constant (in Joules-s), 
$\nu$ is frequency (in 1/s),
$c$ is the speed of light (in m/s), and
$\lambda$ is wavelength (in m).
The human retina responds to a narrow wavelength range of EM radiation
(\humaneyesensitivity{}).
Thus, light is EM radiation within that narrow wavelength range~\cite{campbell2017}, 
weighted by the eye's spectral (i.e., wavelength-specific) sensitivity.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph}.)

@

The second aspect is to note that 
modern lighting is provided via an energy conversion chain:
primary energy (e.g., coal) is converted to
final energy (electricity, measured in W) and lastly to
useful energy (visible light, measured in lumens, lm).
The field of societal exergy analysis evaluates entire energy conversion chains
at regional, national, or world levels in exergy terms and
considers light (and many other useful energy products)
to be enablers of economic growth.
(Energy quantifies the potential to change temperature,
whereas exergy quantifies the potential to do work.
See \citet{Nakicenovic1996} for an early example of societal exergy analysis and
\citet{Heun:2019aa} for a recent example.)

Lighting contributes a non-negligible proportion of total useful exergy
supplied to modern economies, so
an essential metric for societal exergy analysis
is the efficiency with which
electricity (final stage) is converted to light (useful stage) by lamps.
Thus, the efficiency of energy and exergy conversion~($\eta$) from electricity
to light by electric lamps is the focus of this article.
Note that both energy services (e.g., illumination) and satisfaction of human needs
(e.g., comfort, safety, etc.) are downstream of the useful stage 
and thus outside of scope.

\subsection{The conventional method and issues arising}
\label{sec:conventional_method}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Valuable energy conversion efficiency ($\eta_v$)
is defined in simple terms as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_basic_eqn}
 \eta_v = \frac{\text{valuable output}}{\text{energy input}} \; .
\end{equation}
%
When the numerator and denominator are both quantified in energy terms,
an energy efficiency is obtained~($\eta_{E,v}$).
When the numerator and denominator are quantified by exergy,
an exergy efficiency is obtained~($\eta_{X,v}$).

But light (the valuable output) is rarely quantified in energy terms
and almost never in exergy terms.
Instead, light is quantified in lumens.
Indeed, a common interpretation of Equation~\ref{eq:eta_basic_eqn} uses
light (in lm) as the valuable output in the numerator and electricity (in W) as the energy input in the denominator
to obtain luminous efficacy ($K$, in lm/W).
In fact, most lamps are rated and advertised by their lumen output and their luminous efficacy~($K$).
Figure~\ref{fig:LuminousEfficacy_Graph} shows the evolution over time 
of luminous efficacy for four lamp technologies.

\citeauthor{Sousa2017} notes that 
societal exergy analysis is hampered when 
``the useful output cannot or is not
typically measured in energy units''~\cite[p.~17]{Sousa2017}.
Indeed, societal exergy analysts 
need the valuable energy and exergetic efficiencies 
of lamps~($\eta_{E,L,v}$ and $\eta_{X,L,v}$), 
not their luminous efficacy~($K$).
Thus, the widespread use of luminous efficacy~($K$) as a measure of lamp efficiency 
provides a burden to societal exergy analysis.

Conventionally, societal exergy analysts solve this problem by estimating
exergetic efficiency~($\eta_{X,L,v}$) by the ratio of
the minimum energy required to produce a given output and
the actual energy required to produce the same given output, 
as recommended by \citet{Sousa2017}
for sound, information, and lighting.
(See Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach} for additional detail.)
The conventional method is typically implemented 
for lighting via luminous efficacy with
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_eqn}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{K}{K_{max}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $K$ is the actual lamp luminous efficacy and 
$K_{max}$ is the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy.

However, Equation~\ref{eq:eta_eqn} exposes 
a source of confusion, 
namely what value should be used for $K_{max}$?
Within the societal exergy analysis literature and beyond,
three common values are adopted:
220~lm/W \cite{Ayres2003, USDepartmentofEnergyDoE2011},
400~lm/W \cite{Ayres2005, Tsao2010solidstate, Summers1971, Guevara2016}, and
683~lm/W \cite{Kondo2009, Serrenho2014}, based on the maximum efficacy of 
a ***** PB: find the reason for 220~lm/W.---MKH ****, 
broad-spectrum white light, and
green light at 555~nm, respectively.

\citeauthor{Paoli2020} estimated 
the practical upper limit for the luminous efficacy of an LED lamp to be 284--350~lm/W,
when considering all stages of energy loss~\citep{Paoli2020}.
Figure~\ref{fig:LuminousEfficacy_Graph} shows this limit is within reach
due to the exponential improvement in luminous efficacies for LED technology.
The development of LED technology is following Haitz's law, 
which predicts that ``[e]very decade, for a given wavelength of light, 
the cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10 
and the amount of light generated per LED package increases 
by a factor of 20''~\citep{haitz1999case, graydon2007haitz}.

Clearly, there are many options for $K_{max}$, and
its value has a large effect on the valuable exergetic efficiency of lighting
in the conventional method.
So getting it right is important.

Although the confusion around maximum luminous efficacy~($K_{max}$)
is sufficient motivation to dig deeper to fully understand and define
the exergy of light and the exergetic efficiency of lamps, 
further issues and confusions await. 
(See Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.)
Thus, there is ample need for clarity and rigor 
about the thermodynamics of artificial lighting systems.

\subsection{Exergy theory}
\label{sec:framework}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Energy and exergy are two ways to quantify the physical property that,
when transferred to an object,
changes its temperature or performs work on it.
(For this discussion, we can't call the ``physical property'' energy, exergy, work, or heat,
because these concepts need to remain separated. 
So, we use the generic term ``physical property.'')
We discuss energy and exergy quantifications of the physical property in the sections below, 
beginning with heat and work, 
the concepts for which \enaex{} originated.
Thereafter, we develop a framework for the \enaex{} of light
in a parallel manner to the \enaex{} of heat and work.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Enaex{} ($\dot{E}$ and $\dot{X}$) of heat and work} 
\label{sec:energy_and_exergy_of_heat_and_work}
%------------------------------

Energy quantifies the physical property by its heat content.
Thus, heat (the ability to influence temperature) is pure energy.
Thanks to Thompson's cannon experiment~\cite{Thompson:1798aa}, 
we know that work can be converted into heat without loss.

Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} shows a heat engine that converts 
heat at $1$ to 
work at $3$
with a waste heat byproduct at $2$. 
All streams can be counted as energy ($\dot{E}$), such that 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:all_streams_energy}
  \dot{E}_1 = \dot{Q}_1, \; \dot{E}_2 = \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; \dot{E}_3 = \dot{W}_3 \; .
\end{equation}

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A heat engine that uses heat (1) to produce heat (2) and work (3).}
\label{fig:heat_engine}
\end{figure}

Energy efficiency is defined as $\eta_E \equiv \frac{\text{energy out}}{\text{energy in}}$.
For the example of Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_efficiency}
  \eta_E = \frac{\dot{E}_2 + \dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 + \dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1} = 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
because the first law of thermodynamics 
requires that energy is conserved ($\dot{Q}_1 = \dot{Q}_2 + \dot{W}_3$).

That said, typically only one of the products in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} 
is deemed valuable: the work produced by the heat engine ($\dot{W}_3$).
Thus, the \emph{valuable} energy efficiency ($\eta_{E,v}$) is 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:valuable_energy_efficiency}
  \eta_{E,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1} < 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Heat (the ability to influence temperature) is 
only one possible outcome of transferring the physical quantity
from one object to another.
Heat is certainly valuable to humans, but so is another quantity: 
work, the ability to exert a force on another object.
Exergy quantifies the physical property by its work potential
and provides the answer to the question
``what is the maximum work we could obtain from a stream of this physical property?''
Thus, work is pure exergy.

The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics 
states that heat cannot be converted to work without loss. 
To find the maximum possible work that can be created from heat 
(and, therefore, the exergy of heat), 
we consider the Carnot heat engine which operates at the maximum possible valuable energy efficiency~($\eta_C$), 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_C}
  \eta_C = 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{sys}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $T_0$ is the ambient temperature and $T_{sys}$ is a heat temperature 
($T_1$ or $T_2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}).
The exergy of each stream in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine} is then
%
\begin{align}
  \dot{X}_1 &= \phi_1 \dot{Q}_1 = \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) \dot{Q}_1, \\
  \dot{X}_2 &= \phi_2 \dot{Q}_2 = \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \\
  \dot{X}_3 &= \cancelto{1}{\phi_3} \dot{W}_3 = \dot{W}_3 \; .
\end{align}
%
In this context, the Carnot efficiency~($\eta_C$) becomes the exergy-to-energy ratio
for heat streams ($\phi_Q = \eta_C$).
The exergy-to-energy ratio for work is $\phi_3 = \phi_W = 1$, 
because work is pure exergy.

Exergy efficiency is defined as $\eta_X \equiv \frac{\text{exergy out}}{\text{exergy in}}$.
For the heat engine in Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:exergy_efficiency}
  \eta_X = \frac{\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right)  + \dot{W}_3}
                {\dot{Q}_1 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) } < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
because the second law of thermodynamics 
states that exergy is always destroyed ($\dot{X}_1 > \dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3$ or 
$\dot{X}_D = \dot{X}_1 - (\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3)$).

Assuming, again, that work is the valuable output gives
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:valuable_exergy_efficiency}
  \eta_{X,v} = \frac{\dot{W}_3}{\dot{Q}_1 \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) } < \eta_X < 1\; .
\end{equation}

Note that both $\eta_{E,v}$ and $\eta_{X,v}$ 
are independent of human presence.
The work created by the heat engine~($\dot{W}_3$) could be 
a spinning driveshaft on an automobile carrying four passengers down the freeway or
the same spinning driveshaft on a dynamometer in an unoccupied laboratory.
Both
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the \enaex{} of the work and heat at statepoints 2 and 3 and
  
  \item the \enaex{} efficiencies of the heat engine ($\eta_{E,v}$ and $\eta_{X,v}$)
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
would be the same, regardless.
In other words, both 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the \enaex{} of work and heat and
  
  \item the efficiencies of the heat engine
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
are independent of human presence and the energy service provided by the heat engine.

We now turn 
from the production of work by a heat engine
to the production of light by a lamp.

\subsubsection{\Enaex{} of EM radiation ($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)} 
\label{sec:energy_and_exergy_of_EM_rad}
%------------------------------

Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} replaces the heat engine with a lamp 
that produces broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM,3}$)
instead of work~($\dot{W}_3$).
Electricity powers the lamp at 1, and,
like Figure~\ref{fig:heat_engine},
waste heat (conduction and convection only) is produced at 2.

\caption{A lamp that uses electricity~(1) to produce
         heat~(2), broad-spectrum EM radiation~(3), 
         non-light EM radiation~(4), and light~(5).}
\label{fig:lamp}
\end{figure}

Both electricity and EM radiation can be converted to heat without loss, so they are pure energy.
Thus,
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{E}_1 = \dot{W}_{elect,1}, \; \dot{E}_2 = \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; \dot{E}_3 = \dot{E}_{EM,3} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot{E}_{EM,3}$ is the radiant power of broad-spectrum EM radiation
emitted by the lamp in units of energy per unit time.
(When exergy is not involved, the photometry literature often denotes
radiant power by $\Phi$, not $\dot{E}$.
Here, we need to differentiate between 
the energy rate of broad spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$) and
the exergy rate of broad spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{X}_{EM}$),
so we reserve $\Phi$ for lumen output of a lamp. 
See Section~\ref{sec:weighting_functions}.)

The lamp's energy efficiency~($\eta_{E,EM}$) is 
%
\begin{equation}  
  \eta_{E,EM} = \frac{\dot{E}_2 + \dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{Q}_2 + \dot{E}_{EM,3}}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} = 1 \; .
\end{equation}
%
The valuable energy efficiency of the lamp
in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}~($\eta_{E,EM,v}$, also called the wall plug efficiency)
is
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_E_v}
  \eta_{E,EM,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_3}{\dot{E}_1} = \frac{\dot{E}_{EM,3}}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
assuming that broad-spectrum EM radiation at 3 is the valuable output from the lamp.

Because electricity can be converted to work without loss in a frictionless motor,
electricity is considered pure exergy, i.e., $\phi_{elect} = 1$.
Thus, the exergy of the first three streams in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{X}_1 = \cancelto{1}{\phi_{elect}} \dot{W}_{elect,1} = \dot{W}_{elect,1}, \; 
              \dot{X}_2 = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2, \; \text{and} \; 
              \dot{X}_3 = \phi_{\EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\phi_{EM}$ is the exergy-to-energy ratio for broad-spectrum EM radiation. 
(See Section~\ref{sec:phi_light} for details.)

In general, the radiant power of a lamp is a spectral quantity,
meaning that it varies with wavelength.
Spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$)
is the EM emissive power available at any wavelength
and is related~\citep{benenson2006handbook} to radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM}$) by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:emissive_power}
  \dot{E}_{EM} = \int \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}
%
Visually, $\dot{E}_{EM}$ is the area under the $\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ vs.\ $\lambda$ curve.

The exergetic efficiency of EM radiation emitted by the lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{X,EM} = \frac{\dot{X}_2 + \dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} 
          = \frac{\left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_2} \right) \dot{Q}_2 + \phi_{EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} }{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < 1 \; ,
\end{equation}
%
In general, $\phi_{EM}$ is also a spectral quantity.
(See Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}.)
The valuable exergetic efficiency of the EM radiation emitted by the lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp} is given by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_X_v}
  \eta_{X,EM,v} = \frac{\dot{X}_3}{\dot{X}_1} 
              = \frac{\phi_{EM} \dot{E}_{EM,3} }{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} < \eta_{X,EM} < 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Note that the efficiencies are independent of human presence;
$\eta_{X,EM}$ and $\eta_{X,EM,v}$ would be the same, 
whether the lamp is illuminating
an unoccupied room or a crowded bar, 
whether the illumination stimulates the rods and cones of a human eye or
excites band gap electrons in an amorphous silicon solar cell.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Enaex{} of light ($\dot{E}_{L}$ and $\dot{X}_{L}$)} 
\label{sec:human_perception_of_EM_radiation}
%------------------------------

We noted above that both
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item \enaex{} of broad-spectrum EM radiation and

  \item EM energy and exergetic efficiency of lamps

\end{enumerate*}
%
are independent of human presence.
But what about human \emph{perception}?

Human beings perceive heat by temperature and light by wavelength.
Human skin can perceive the thermal radiation portion of the broader electromagnetic spectrum,
approximately 100 nm < $\lambda$ < 10,000 nm, and 
human skin is differentially responsive to EM spectrum wavelength~\citep{Anderson:1981aa}.  
Indeed, thermoreceptors in the dermis of skin are important sensors
for regulation of body temperature~\cite[p.~258]{Jones:2016aa}.
Similarly, human eyes perceive only a (narrower) portion of the EM radiation spectrum
(approximately \humaneyesensitivity).
To quantify the energy (and exergy) of light, 
we must move from the \enaex{} of broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to the \enaex{} of light~($\dot{E}_{L}$ and $\dot{X}_{L}$). 
But how?

Knowing that visual perception of light is a function of wavelength
leads to modifying Equation~\ref{eq:emissive_power}
to include a spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$) such that
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:weighted_emissive_power}
  \dot{E}_L = \int \dot{E}_{L,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda = \int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
with $0 \le f_\lambda \le 1$
and $\dot{E}_{L,\lambda} = f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$.

In Equation~\ref{eq:weighted_emissive_power}, 
the spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$) converts 
from broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to light~($\dot{E}_{L}$ and $\dot{X}_{L}$), 
the valuable part of EM radiation for illumination.
In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_dot_5}
  \dot{E}_{L,5} = \int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

In Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, any EM radiation at statepoint 3 
\emph{not} converted to light
is quantified as non-light EM radiation at statepoint 4~($\dot{E}_{N,4}$).
Specifically,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N_dot_5}
  \dot{E}_{N,4} = \int (1 - f_\lambda) \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{The exergy-to-energy ratio of EM radiation ($\phi_{\EM}$)}
\label{sec:phi_light}
%------------------------------

Recent advances in the thermodynamics of radiation community
enable converting the energy of EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$)
into the exergy of EM radiation~($\dot{X}_{EM}$).
The exergy-to-energy ratio of EM radiation
($\phi_{\EM}$, called the ``radiative exergy-energy coefficient'' in that community)
is given by Petela's Equation~\cite{petela1964exergy}:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:petelas_equation}
 \phi_{\EM} = 1 - \frac{4}{3}\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}} + \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\right)^4 \; .
\end{equation}

Petela's equation has recently been verified via an infinite-staged
Carnot heat engine model \cite{zhou2017exergy}
that is powered by radiative energy transfer.
In the radiative Carnot model, a photon possessing a characteristic frequency 
and photon effective temperature enters a medium that acts as an ideal absorber. 
The photon transfers an infinitesimal quantity of energy to the absorber via thermal radiation.
The energy enters an infinitesimally small Carnot heat engine and performs work. 
The absorber then emits another photon at lower energy and frequency,
and therefore lower photon effective temperature. 
This process repeats until the frequency of the photon equals zero
and the photon effective temperature ($T_\lambda$)~\cite{Shan2019}
equals the reference temperature ($T_0$).

However, Petela's equation assumes a blackbody emitter and
a blackbody absorber 
at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_0$, respectively.
To determine $\phi_{\EM}$ for a non-blackbody lamp,
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio ($\phi_{\EM,\lambda}$),
must be calculated.
An effective temperature of light photons~\cite{chen2008} ($T_\lambda$) 
provides the link between Petela's equation (Equation~\ref{eq:petelas_equation})
and the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{\EM,\lambda}$).
The product of wavelength and photon effective temperature 
is a constant~($c_3$ in \citet{chen2008}) such that
%
\begin{equation}
  \lambda T_{\lambda} = c_{3} = 5.33016 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m-K} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
or
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_lambda}
  T_\lambda = \frac{5.33016 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m-K}}{\lambda} \; .
\end{equation}

We note that the photon effective temperature approach has been criticized by 
\citeauthor{liu2009},
who argued that it is inappropriate
``to endue a single photon with macro-scale thermodynamic parameters
such as exergy and entropy''~\citep[p.~1810]{liu2009}.
We acknowledge this critique, 
but we also note that here $T_\lambda$ is ascribed to a stream of photons
traveling from a lamp to an eye.
Thus, for our purposes, $T_\lambda$ can be considered the statistical average effective temperature 
of that stream of photons.
****
Is this a good way to address the critique?---MKH
****

We make the assumption that the mechanism
by which light is converted into electrical nerve signals
in the human eye
is radiative EM energy transfer
from a light source~(1) to an eye~(0).
We assume no losses in radiative transmission
between the lamp and the iris,
i.e., no radiation scattering occurs through air, 
an assumption that holds for short distances typically 
observed in lighting applications (<~10~m).
(See \citet{Shan2019} for a method to estimate transmission losses
over longer distances.)
We further assume that the human iris is a blackbody absorber 
(absorbing all wavelengths of radiation perfectly \cite{benenson2006handbook}), 
being a small aperture on a larger cavity.
(In this assumption, we follow \citet[p.~172]{Rossing2020} who state
``another good example of [a blackbody absorber] is the human eye;
the pupil looks black because most light entering it is trapped and absorbed.'')
Thus, we use Shan and Zhou's~\cite{Shan2019} spectral formulation of Petela's equation,
which replaces the temperature of the emitter ($T_1$) by photon effective temperature~($T_\lambda$):
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_EM_lambda_shan_zhou}
 \phi_{\EM,\lambda} = 1 - \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{T_{0}}{T_{\lambda}} \right)
                        + \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T_{\lambda}}\right)^4 \; .
\end{equation}
%
Further, Equation~\ref{eq:T_lambda} can be substituted into Equation~\ref{eq:phi_EM_lambda_shan_zhou}
(in the form $T_\lambda = c_3 / \lambda$),
and $T_0$ can be taken as 310~K, the temperature of the human body.
The result is an equation for $\phi_{L,\lambda}$, the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio of light:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou}
 \phi_{L,\lambda} = 1 
                    - \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{310 \text{ K}}{c_3} \right) \lambda 
                    + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{310 \text{ K}}{c_3} \right)^4 \lambda^4 \; .
\end{equation}

The exergy of light emitted by a non-blackbody lamp~($\dot{X}_L$)
is found by integrating the product of
the spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$),
a spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$), and
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$)
with respect to wavelength.
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_dot_L}
  \dot{X}_L = \int \phi_{L,\lambda} \, f_\lambda \, \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda
\end{equation}

The quotient of $\dot{X}_L$ and $\dot{E}_L$ gives 
the exergy-energy ratio of light~($\phi_{L}$), 
which is specific to each combination of
weighting function and lamp ($f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_L}
  \phi_{L} = \frac{\dot{X}_L}{\dot{E}_L} 
           = \frac {\int \phi_{L,\lambda} f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda}
                       {\int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Lighting efficiency of a lamp} 
\label{sec:light_efficiency}
%------------------------------

If the valuable product of a lamp is considered to be its light~($\dot{E}_L$ or $\dot{X}_L$)
as opposed to its broad-spectrum EM radiation~($\dot{E}_{EM}$ or $\dot{X}_{EM}$),
Equations~\ref{eq:eta_E_v} and~\ref{eq:eta_X_v} require modification.
In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}, the valuable energy efficiency of a lamp becomes
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_E_v_light}
  \eta_{E,L,v} = \frac{\dot{E}_5}{\dot{E}_{elect,1}} 
               = \frac{\int f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
and the valuable exergetic efficiency of a lamp becomes
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_X_v_light}
  \eta_{X,L,v} = \frac{\dot{X}_5}{\dot{X}_{elect,1}} 
               = \frac{\int \phi_{L,\lambda} f_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Luminous weighting functions}
\label{sec:weighting_functions}
%------------------------------

Spectral luminous weighting functions ($f_\lambda$) convert 
radiant power ($\dot{E}_{EM}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM}$)
to light ($\dot{E}_L$ and $\dot{X}_L$).
(See Section~\ref{sec:human_perception_of_EM_radiation}.)
We use four spectral luminous weighting functions relevant to illumination
to enable example calculations.
(See Section~\ref{sec:results}.)

The first luminous weighting function option is degenerate: 
the analyst could decide to ignore the nuances of human visual perception altogether,
implicitly assuming that all EM radiation emitted from a lamp counts as light, 
whether or not it is within the visible portion of the EM spectrum.
For the first option, the degenerate (unweighted, uw) 
luminous weighting function ($f_{\lambda,uw}$) is
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f1}
  f_{\lambda,uw} = 1 \; .
\end{equation}

Second, the analyst could 
deem a lamp's EM radiation to be useful if and only if it \emph{could}
stimulate photoreceptive cells in the human eye,
regardless of the spectral sensitivity of those cells.
In the second option, the analyst excludes wavelengths outside the range of perception by the human eye
when determining the \enoex{} of light.
For the second option (visible, vis),
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f2}
f_{\lambda,vis} =
  \begin{cases}
    0 \; , & \text{for } \lambda < 380 \text{ nm} \\
    1 \; , & \text{for } 380 \text{ nm} \le \lambda \le 750 \text{ nm} \\
    0 \; , & \text{for } 750 \text{ nm} < \lambda \\
  \end{cases} \; .
\end{equation}

But the human eye is spectrally sensitive to EM radiation, 
with peak sensitivity at 555~nm (green)
and lesser sensitivities at both longer (redder) and shorter (bluer) wavelengths.
A third option weights a lamp's emitted EM radiation 
by the photopic sensitivity of the human eye.
The photopic luminous~(pl) weighting function~($V_\lambda$) describes this sensitivity, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Vis_Graph}.
The photopic luminous weighting function 
was defined by the Commission Internationale de l' \'{E}clairage (CIE) in 1931
and represents the sensitivity of M and L cones
at daytime light levels \cite{CVRL2008}.
So for Option 3,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f3}
  f_{\lambda,pl} = V_\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:f3} into Equation~\ref{eq:weighted_emissive_power}
yields
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{E}_{L,pl} = \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
which provides the basis for calculating a lamp's output 
of visible light~($\Phi_{pl}$) in the unit of lumens~(lm):
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lumen}
  \Phi_{pl} = (683 \text{ lm/W}) \, \dot{E}_{L,pl} 
            = (683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where 683~lm/W is the luminous efficiency of a perfect light source
emitting exclusively green light at $\lambda = 555 \text{ nm}$.
(Note that because lumens are a re-scaling of watts, 
lumens are also a unit of radiant power.)

When the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$) is used 
to calculate luminous power, 
the valuable energy efficiency of a lamp can be written in terms of luminous efficacy~($K$)
by modifying Equation~\ref{eq:eta_E_v_light} to be (in the context of Figure~\ref{fig:lamp})
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lum_effic_def}
  K \equiv \frac{(683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $K$ is in lm/watt.

The photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$) is the industry standard for determining lumen output
of lamps, but it has been criticized for under-representing
the power of wavelengths different from 555~nm. 
In fact, the photopic luminous weighting function
neglects the differential sensitivity of the human eye's other light receptors,
namely the short-wave cones,
rods, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs),
which are responsible for vision in low-light settings and
physiological functions such as the regulation of circadian rhythms.
Thus, the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$),
and therefore also luminous efficacy~($K$),
are said to have a long-wave bias.

A fourth option (universal, univ) weights 
a lamp's spectral radiant power~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$)
by the spectral sensitivity of all five light receptors in the human eye
(not just the M and L cones as does $V_\lambda$). 
The universal luminous weighting function ($U_\lambda$) \cite{Rea2018}
captures the actual, broader sensitivity of the human eye.
So for option 4,
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f4}
  f_{\lambda,univ} = U_\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

Table~\ref{tab:wfs} summarizes the luminous weighting functions discussed above.

\input{pieces/wfs.tex}

To demonstrate how the spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$)
affects the energy and exergy efficiency of lamps, 
we need both luminous weighting functions (Section~\ref{sec:weighting_functions}) and
example lamps, the topic of the next section.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Lamps}
\label{sec:lamps}
%------------------------------

We obtained spectral power distributions (SPDs) of the lamps in Table~\ref{tab:lamps} from the 
Light Spectral Power Distribution Database (LSPDD)~\cite{Roby, miguel2017, aube2013}. 
The data in the LSPDD are provided 
in terms of \emph{relative intensity} ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,rel}$) 
as opposed to \emph{absolute intensity} ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$).
Because lamps in the LSPDD are not measured using an integration sphere,
the integral of the SPD may not match the radiant power of the lamp
reported by the manufacturer.
To ensure that the integral of each lamp's SPD 
matches its reported radiant power, 
we applied the standard procedure of scaling the SPD 
by the ratio ($\mu$) of
the radiant power given by the manufacturer~($K \, \dot{W}_{elect,1}$) to  
the integral of the spectral radiant power taken from the relative intensity data~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,rel}$).
%
\begin{equation} 
  \mu \equiv \frac{K \, \dot{W}_{elect,1}}{\dot{E}_{EM,rel}} \; .
\end{equation}

We then applied the scaling factor~($\mu$) to the SPD data for each lamp, 
yielding a corrected SPD~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$) for each lamp 
that matches the manufacturer's reported radiant power. 
%
\begin{equation} 
  \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}  = \mu \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,rel}
\end{equation}

Although the corrected SPD data were used for all analyses,
we later display normalized SPD for each lamp,
such that the peak of each SPD is 1.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}.)
This normalizing process enables visual comparison 
of lamps with varying electricity consumption rates
and SPD profiles.

We selected one representative lamp for each of four common lamp technologies
(incandescent, INC;
halogen, HAL;
compact fluorescent, CFL; and
light emitting diode, LED), 
each with a unique SPD.
See Table~\ref{tab:lamps} for details about lamps discussed throughout this article.

Results are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps} for 
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio for light~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$), 
spectral luminous weighting functions~($f_\lambda$),
the normalized spectral emissive power of lamps~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$), and
spectral light emitted by lamps~($\dot{E}_{L,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{L,\lambda}$).

\subsection{Radiant power ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$ and $\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$)}
\label{sec:results_radiant_power}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The four graphs in the top-right of Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}
show normalized spectral radiant power ($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$) 
at the top of the gray region for each lamp.
Applying Equation~\ref{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou} 
to the four lamps identified in Section~\ref{sec:lamps}
gives spectral radiant power in exergy terms ($\dot{X}_{EM,\lambda}$),
shown by the dark green line.
The areas of the gray regions ($\dot{E}_{EM}$) are given by Equation~\ref{eq:emissive_power}.
The areas beneath the dark green lines in all graphs are the exergy of light~($\dot{X}_L$), 
given by Equation~\ref{eq:X_dot_L}.

Note that exergy (dark green line) is very close to energy (top of the gray regions)
for all lamps, because
the exergy-to-energy ratio ($\phi_{L,\lambda}$) is always close to~1 for EM wavelengths relevant to light.
The difference between energy and exergy is greatest in the upper right of the graphs where both

for the four lamps and four weighting functions of 
Sections~\ref{sec:weighting_functions} and~\ref{sec:lamps}
and Tables~\ref{tab:wfs} and~\ref{tab:lamps}, respectively.
Each rainbow colored region shows the energy content of light (spectral luminous power) and
is the spectral product of its row's weighting function and its column's lamp's SPD.
The areas of the rainbow colored regions ($\dot{E}_L$) are given by Equation~\ref{eq:L_dot_5}.
The areas beneath the dark green lines ($\dot{X}_L$) are given by 
Equation~\ref{eq:X_dot_L}.

Valuable energy efficiencies~($\eta_{E,L,v}$) of the various combinations of weighting functions and lamps
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:results_etas}.
Note that when a luminous weighting function is specified,
the lighting~($L$) and valuable~($v$) subscripts are implied and replaced by the weighting function specifier.
(E.g., the valuable~($v$) energy~($E$) efficiency~($\eta$) of light~($L$) 
using the visible luminous weighting function~($vis$),
$\eta_{E,L,v,vis}$, is written unambiguously as $\eta_{E,vis}$,

\subsection{Comparison between conventional and exact methods
            to calculating exergetic efficiency~($\eta_{X,L,v}$)}
\label{sec:compwithSEA}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The exact method for calculating the exergetic efficiency of lamps
presented in Section~\ref{sec:light_efficiency}
differs from the conventional method 
used in the societal exergy analysis community (Section~\ref{sec:conventional_method}).
This section
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item adds detail to the conventional method and
  
  \item evaluates the conventional method relative to the exact method,
        leading to three implications for societal exergy analysis
        (Section~\ref{sec:implications_for_sea}).
    
\end{enumerate*}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Conventional and exact methods} 
\label{sec:previous_approach}
%------------------------------

The conventional method (Section~\ref{sec:conventional_method}) 
estimates the valuable exergetic efficiency of lighting by the quotient of
the theoretical minimum rate of energy required to emit one lumen and
the actual rate of energy used to emit one lumen 
for a given lamp. 
The minimum and actual energy rates are obtained 
by inverting luminous efficacies.
For a lamp, the quotient is between the lamp's luminous efficacy~($K$)
and the maximum luminous efficacy~($K_{max}$).
Thus, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:K_over_e_max}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{\; \; \frac{1}{K_{max}} \; \; }{\frac{1}{K}}
       = \frac{K}{K_{max}} \; ,
\end{equation}
% 
a restating of Equation~\ref{eq:eta_eqn}.

Equation~\ref{eq:lum_effic_def} shows that 
the luminous efficacy of a lamp~($K$) is equal to the quotient
of the luminous power ($\Phi_{pl}$, Equation~\ref{eq:lumen}), expressed in lm, and
the electricity consumption rate of the device
($\dot{W}_{elect,1}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:lamp}), expressed in W.
Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:lum_effic_def} into Equation~\ref{eq:K_over_e_max} restates
(with reference to Figure~\ref{fig:lamp})
valuable exergetic efficiency for the conventional method:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{ \; \; \frac{(683 \text{ lm/W}) \int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \,
          \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}} \; \;}{K_{max}} \; .
\end{equation}

With recent advances in photometry and the thermodynamics of radiation 
(Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}),
it is now possible to determine the energy and exergy of light exactly, 
thereby relieving societal exergy analysts
of the need to estimate exergetic efficiency
by the quotient of
the minimum energy required to produce a lumen and
the actual energy required to produce a lumen.
Thus, we can evaluate the conventional method in light of recent advances, 
using exergetic efficiency~($\eta_{X,L,v}$) as the point of comparison.

Comparing Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light} (the conventional method)
to Equation~\ref{eq:eta_X_v_light} (the exact method)
reveals that the conventional method for calculating the exergetic efficiency of lighting
is correct under the following conditions only:
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$) is assumed to be 683~lm/W, 

  \item $\phi_{L,\lambda} = 1$ for all wavelengths, and

  \item the spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$) is taken to be
        the photopic luminous weighting function ($V_\lambda$).

\end{enumerate}

Condition~(a) shows that the correct assumption for maximum luminous efficacy 
in the conventional method 
is $K_{max} = 683 \text{ lm/W}$.
Any other assumption is a mistake.
The assumption in condition~(b) is incorrect;
the exergy-to-energy ratio for light~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$) is not 1, but the conventional method assumes it is.
Condition~(c) highlights an unfortunate requirement of the conventional method, 
one that is lifted by the exact method.

When $K_{max}$ is equal to 683~lm/W and
the weighting function is taken to be the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$),
as they should for the conventional method,
Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light} simplifies to 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light_final}
  \eta_{X,L,v} \approx \frac{\int V_\lambda \dot{E}_{EM,\lambda,3} \mathrm{d}\lambda}{\dot{W}_{elect,1}}\; .
\end{equation}
%
So, the conventional method's estimate 
of a lamp's valuable exergetic efficiency
(Equation~\ref{eq:K_over_e_max}) 
reduces to Equation~\ref{eq:prev_eta_X_v_light_final}, 
which is the same as Equation~\ref{eq:eta_E_v_light},
the valuable energy efficiency of a lamp, 
if $f_\lambda = V_\lambda$.
That is to say, one interpretation of the conventional method
is that it incorrectly estimates the 
\emph{exergetic} efficiency of a lamp 
by its \emph{energy} efficiency.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Implications for societal exergy analysis} 
\label{sec:implications_for_sea}
%------------------------------

<<ErrorCalcs>>=
correct_eff <- 683 # lm/W
wrong_eff_220 <- 220 # lm/W
wrong_eff_400 <- 400 # lm/W
wrong_rat_220 <- correct_eff / wrong_eff_220
wrong_rat_400 <- correct_eff / wrong_eff_400
@

The above comparison between the conventional method (Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach}) and
the exact method (Section~\ref{sec:framework})
raises three implications for societal exergy analysis.
First, with the conventional method, 
the analyst is required to select a value for maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$), 
the denominator of Equation~\ref{eq:K_over_e_max}.
The choice of $K_{max}$ can make a significant difference to the results.
The correct value for $K_{max}$ is 683~lm/W,
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach}.
We showed in Section~\ref{sec:conventional_method} that
some authors have incorrectly, we now know, taken $K_{max}$ to be 
220~lm/W or 400~lm/W,
thereby overestimating exergetic efficiency of lighting~($\eta_{X,L,v}$)
with the conventional method
by a factor of
$\frac{\Sexpr{correct_eff} \text{ lm/W}}{\Sexpr{wrong_eff_220} \text{ lm/W}} 
  = \Sexpr{format(round(wrong_rat_220, 1), nsmall = 1)}$
or
$\frac{\Sexpr{correct_eff} \text{ lm/W}}{\Sexpr{wrong_eff_400} \text{ lm/W}} 
  = \Sexpr{format(round(wrong_rat_400, 1), nsmall = 1)}$,
respectively.

Second, to obtain the correct exergetic efficiency of lighting, 
analysts must reject the conventional method assumption that $\phi_{L,\lambda} = 1$.
Recent progress in the exergy of radiation literature enables this rejection, 
following the methods of Section~\ref{sec:phi_light}.
Specifically, the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio of light ($\phi_{L,\lambda}$)
of Equation~\ref{eq:phi_L_lambda_shan_zhou} and Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps} should be used.
We note, however, that $\phi_{L,\lambda}$ is close to~1 for all wavelengths of interest to illumination.
Happily, the conventional method was not far wrong.

Third, in the conventional method, 
the analyst is required to use the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$)
for the spectral weighting function~($f_\lambda$).
However, it is not certain that the photopic luminous weighting function
is the best choice.
In fact, we later recommend replacing the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$)
with the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$).
(See Section~\ref{sec:reccuniv}.)


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Recommendations}
\label{sec:recommendations}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We provide three recommendations for societal exergy analysts:
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item use the exact method of Section~\ref{sec:methods} when possible, 
        i.e., when SPD data are available for a lamp, 
  
  \item use the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$) always, and
  
  \item use an approximate method when luminous efficacy~($K$) data are available, but
        SPD data are not.
    
\end{enumerate*}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Recommendation for the exact method} 
\label{sec:recommend_exact_method}
%------------------------------

Our first recommendation is for use of the 
exact method~(Section~\ref{sec:light_efficiency})
for determining the valuable exergy efficiency of lamps~($\eta_{X,L,v}$)
when SPD data are available.
The exact method provides the following benefits over the conventional method:
%
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item it is free of any assumptions for the maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$),

  \item it uses the correct spectral exergy-to-energy ratio, no longer assuming $\phi_{L,\lambda} = 1$, and 
  
  \item it allows choices for the spectral luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$), 
        no longer requiring $f_\lambda = V_\lambda$, 
        thereby enabling our second recommendation ($f_\lambda = U_\lambda$).

\end{enumerate}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Recommendation for the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$)} 
\label{sec:reccuniv}
%------------------------------

We recognize that the choice of spectral weighting function 
remains contentious~\cite{Delgado-Bonal:2017aa, Pattison2018LEDphotons, Rea2018, Royer2016}.
But we suggest that the choice of weighting function ($f_\lambda$) in societal exergy analysis
should be appropriate for each lamp's application.
Our second recommendation is for use of
the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$) in societal exergy analysis
when the purpose of lamps is illumination.

For the application of illumination, 
we note that human perception of light and color diminishes rapidly above 700~nm,
as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}.
(Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}  
utilizes the CIE 10 degree color matching function 
provided in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{ggspectra}~\cite{Aphalo2015}.)
This decline in human eye sensitivity toward the infra-red region
is captured well by the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$).

However, it is also known that short wavelength EM radiation (bluer light)
provides physiological benefits, such as
the suppression of melanopsin and 
the regulation of circadian rhythms~\citep{Pattison2018LEDphotons}.
The photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$) does not
capture the importance of short wavelength EM radiation, 
attenuating human perception nearly equally in the blue and red regions
of the visible spectrum.

Societal exergy analysis implicitly adopts the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$)
when it applies the conventional method for calculating the exergetic efficiency of lighting.
(See Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach}.)
For lamps whose purpose is illumination, 
we believe that the universal luminous weighting function ($U_\lambda$)
is more appropriate.
(See also \citet{Rea2018}.)
We provide three arguments in support of this recommendation.

First, 
the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$)
accounts for the sensitivity of all five types of light receptors in the human eye,
whereas the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$) does not.

Second,
to obtain the benefits of blue light, 
many lamps are designed with a blue spike 
in the region of 480~nm, 
the peak of the melanopsin suppression action spectrum \cite{lucas2014}.
(For example, see the blue spike in the SPD~($\dot{E}_{EM,\lambda}$)
for the LED lamp in Figure~\ref{fig:wfs_and_lamps}.)
The universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$)
correctly includes the energy or exergy of blue spikes
in the numerator of efficiency calculations,
thereby correctly elevating the efficiency of lamps that contain a blue spike
compared to the photopic luminous weighting function.

Third, 
manufacturers who design lamps with blue spikes
do not get credit for their efforts, because 
the industry-standard measure of lighting efficiency,
luminous efficacy~($K$), 
uses the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$). 
This state of affairs could encourage lighting manufacturers to reduce short wavelength
output of lamps, even when short wavelength EM radiation would 
provide physiological benefits.
Adopting the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$) will encourage manufacturers to include 
blue spikes in lamp designs.

The conventional method for estimating lamp efficiency
requires the use of the photopic luminous weighting function and cannot do any different.
However, a switch away from the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$)
toward the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$) is
made possible by the exact method described in Section~\ref{sec:framework},
so long as SPD data are available.
In the absence of SPD data, 
we suggest that an approximate method can be used, as discussed in the next section.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Recommendation for an approximate method} 
\label{sec:approximate_method}
%------------------------------

Our third recommendation is for an approximate method to determine 
the valuable exergetic efficiency of lamps~($\eta_{X,L,v}$)
when SPD data are not available
but luminous efficacy data~($K$) are.
Results from the exact method provide guidance for developing an approximate method.

Section~\ref{sec:previous_approach} shows that the conventional method does not require SPD information, 
but it produces energy efficiency (instead of exergetic efficiency)
while requiring the use of photopic luminous weighting function~($\eta_{E,pl}$).
In contrast, we recommend that,
in the absence of SPD data,
societal exergy analysts
calculate exergetic efficiency 
with the universal luminous weighting function~($\eta_{X,univ}$).

We suggest the following two-step process, 
using the conventional method as a starting point:
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item move from valuable energy efficiency~($\eta_{E,pl}$)
        to valuable exergetic efficiency ($\eta_{X,pl}$)
        using an average exergy-to-energy ratio~($\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$) and 
  
  \item move from valuable exergetic efficiency determined with the photopic luminous weighting function~($\eta_{X,pl}$)
        to valuable exergetic efficiency determined with the universal luminous weighting function~($\eta_{X,univ}$)
        using an average ratio between those efficiencies ($\gammaratavg{}$).
    
\end{enumerate*}

phi_conversion <- overall_phi$phi_count

phi_mean <- overall_phi$phi_mean
  
phi_sd <- overall_phi$phi_sd

phi_and_gammaX_factor <- conversionX_mean * phi_mean
@

We calculated the exergy-to-energy ratio for a sample of lamps from the LSPDD \cite{aube2013}
using Equation~\ref{eq:phi_L} with $f_\lambda = V_\lambda$. 
(The sample consists of \Sexpr{conversion_count} lamp SPDs representing six technologies: 
INC, Halogen (HAL), HPS, Metal halide (MH), CFL, and LED)
The average value is $\bar{\phi}_{L,pl} = \Sexpr{format(round(phi_mean, 2), nsmall = 2)}$ 
with a remarkably small standard deviation of $\sigma_{\phi_{L,pl}} = \Sexpr{format(round(phi_sd, 5), nsmall = 5)}$.

Similarly, we obtained $\gammarat{}$ for each lamp~($i$) by taking the quotient of efficiencies:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:conversionuniversal}
  \gammarat{}_{,i} = \frac{\eta_{X,univ,i}}{\eta_{X,pl,i}} \; .
\end{equation}
%

Because a greater proportion of each SPD is considered to be light
by the universal luminous weighting function~($U_\lambda$)
compared to the photopic luminous weighting function~($V_\lambda$), 
$\gammarat{}$ is expected to be greater than 1.
The average value of the photopic-to-universal factor across our population of lamps 
was $\gammaratavg{} = \Sexpr{format(round(conversionX_mean, 2), nsmall = 2)}$,
with a small standard deviation of $\sigma_{\gammarat{}} = \Sexpr{format(round(conversionX_sd, 2), nsmall = 2)}$.

**** MKH: I believe we need to add a sentence on the approximate equivalency 
of the photopic-to-universal factor in both the energy and exergy spaces.
See paragraph below. ---ZM ****

The photopic-to-universal factor ($\gammaratavg{}$) operates in the exergy space 
after application of the exergy-to-energy factor ($\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$).
However, given that the values of $\gammaratavg{}_{,X}$ and $\gammaratavg{}_{,E}$
are approximately equivalent, 
$\Sexpr{format(round(conversionX_mean, 3), nsmall = 3)}$
$\pm$ $\Sexpr{format(round(conversionX_sd, 3), nsmall = 3)}$
, and $\Sexpr{format(round(conversion_mean, 3), nsmall = 3)}$
$\pm$ $\Sexpr{format(round(conversion_sd, 3), nsmall = 3)}$
respectively, 
the analyst may use the photopic-to-universal factors ($\gammaratavg{}$) supplied
before or after the application of the exergy-to-energy factor.

**** MKH: Alternatively we provide factors for both the energy and exergy space in the appendix
this is easy enough! ---ZM ****


Average conversion factors~($\gammaratavg{}$) by lamp technology are given in Table~\ref{tab:conversionfactors} in the appendix.

The approximate method for determining the valuable exergetic efficiency of a lamp
is implemented by the following equation
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:approximate}
  \eta_{X,univ} \approx \bar{\phi}_{L,pl} \, \gammaratavg{} \, \frac{K}{683 \text{ lm/W}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
which is a modification of Equation~\ref{eq:K_over_e_max}
that approximates the move from energy to exergy
assuming the photopic luminous weighting function (via $\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$)
and the move from the photopic luminous weighting function to the universal luminous weighting function
in the exergy space (via $\gammaratavg{}$).

When the lamp technology is unknown, overall average values can be used
for $\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$ and $\gammaratavg{}$:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:approximate_unknown_tech}
  \eta_{X,univ} \approx (\Sexpr{format(round(phi_mean, 2), nsmall = 2)}) (\Sexpr{format(round(conversionX_mean, 2), nsmall = 2)}) \frac{K}{683 \text{ lm/W}} = \Sexpr{format(round(phi_and_gammaX_factor, 2), nsmall = 2)} \frac{K}{683 \text{ lm/W}} \; .
\end{equation}
%
If the lamp technology is known, 
$\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$ and $\gammaratavg{}$ values from Tables~\ref{tab:mean_phi_p2_by_lamp_type} and~\ref{tab:conversionfactors} should be used instead of the overall averages.

Table~\ref{tab:threemethods} summarizes 
the valuable exergetic efficiency 
for the four representative lamps (INC, HAL, CFL, LED) and
the three methods (conventional, exact, and approximate).

\subsection{Aggregate lighting efficiencies}
\label{sec:AggEfficiencies}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Societal exergy analyses are normally conducted at the sectoral or economy-wide scale, 
so analysts must weight per-lamp-technology efficiencies
by each technology's usage fraction.
Two types of data are required for a given period of interest, typically a year:
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]

  \item valuable exergetic efficiency data for each lamp technology~($\eta_{X,univ,i}$) and

  \item proportion of lighting electricity consumption by lamp technology~($\theta_i$),

\end{enumerate*}
%
where $i$ denotes individual lighting technologies.

Item (a) is the result of applying the exact method to each lamp technology
but depends on the availability of each technology's SPD,
which are not often known.
Instead, the most common measure of lighting efficiency reported for lamps is the luminous efficacy~($K$).
Therefore, to develop an aggregate measure of lighting efficiency, 
luminous efficacy data must be converted into valuable exergetic efficiency values 
using conversion factors, namely $\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$ and $\gammaratavg{}$, in the approximate method.
(See Section~\ref{sec:approximate_method}.)

Importantly, data for the usage proportion for each lamp technology~($\theta_i$)
for each year of the study are needed,
ideally in the form of the proportion of lighting electricity consumed by each lamp type.
Such data (and luminous efficacy values, $K_i$)
are provided by the US DOE's Lighting Market Characterization reports \citep{DOE2002, DOE2012, DOE2017}
for the USA for the following lamp technologies: incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent,
linear fluorescent, high intensity discharge, LED, and other.

When SPDs are available, the exact method can be used to determine the 
valuable exergetic efficiency of each lighting technology~($i$), and
the aggregate valuable exergetic lighting efficiency for a particular year can be found by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg_eta}
  \eta_{X,univ,agg} = \sum \limits_{i} \theta_{i} \, \eta_{X,univ,i} \; .
\end{equation}
%

When SPDs are not available, the approximate method can be used as follows:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:agg_eta_K}
  \eta_{X,univ,agg} \approx \sum \limits_{i} \theta_{i} \, \bar{\phi}_{L,pl} \, \gammaratavg{} \, 
                            \frac{K_{i}}{683 \text{ lm/W}} \; .
\end{equation}

\section{Summary and future work}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.

Several recent developments in the photometry and thermodynamics of radiation literatures 
(Petela's equation;
the photon effective temperature, $T_\lambda$; and
the spectral exergy-to-energy ratio, $\phi_{L,\lambda}$) 
have enabled
a re-evaluation of the exergy of light and the exergetic efficiency of electric lamps
applicable to societal exergy analysis.
We built upon those advances to provide 
clear and rigorous definitions of the energy and exergy of light.
We developed a novel exact method for determining the exergetic efficiency of lamps
involving the 
spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$), 
a luminous weighting function~($f_\lambda$), and 
broad-spectrum lamp luminous power~($\dot{E}_{EM}$).
We showed that the exact method

  \item is free of any assumptions for the maximum luminous efficacy ($K_{max}$),
  
  \item uses the correct spectral exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_{L,\lambda}$), and
  
  \item allows choices for the spectral luminous weighting function ($f_\lambda$).
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
(a)--(c) are improvements over the conventional method.
The exact method requires the availability of a lamp's spectral power distribution.
For cases when a spectral power distribution is not available, 
we developed a novel approximate method,
involving surprisingly stable values 
of the exergy-to-energy ratio~($\phi_L$) and 
the photopic-to-universal factor~($\gammarat{}$)
across lighting technologies.
Finally, we provided recommendations for societal exergy analysts, namely to
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item use the exact method when a lamp's spectral power distribution is available, 
  
  \item use the universal luminous weighting weighting function~($U_\lambda$), and
  
  \item use the approximate method when luminous efficacy is known
        but spectral power distribution is not.
  
\end{enumerate*}

Future work could include
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
	\item investigating additional lighting technologies to assess the stability of 
	      the average exergy-to-energy ratio~($\bar{\phi}_{L,pl}$) and 
	      the average photopic-to-universal factor~($\gammaratavg{}$)
	      across lighting technologies,
	
  \item applying the exact method to understand the evolution
        of lighting technology relative to upper limits to
        reducing lighting energy consumption~\citep{CullenPhD}
        (via gains in 
        lamp luminous efficacy~($K$) and valuable exergetic efficiency, $\eta_{X,L,v}$),
  
  \item understanding the effect of lamp ``waste'' heat on lamp efficiency
        (lamp heat is beneficial when it displaces energy for winter space heating but
        detrimental when it adds to summer cooling loads), and 
  
  \item pushing toward the services stage of the energy conversion chain
        to assess the effects of waste light 
        (caused by 
        excessive intensity, 
        lighting that falls on surfaces that do not require illumination, or
        under-utilization of light due to under-occupancy of spaces).
