% This table displays the exergy to energy factors for each lamp weighting function combination.

\begin{table}
\centering % Centered table
\caption{Exergy to energy ratios for each of the selected lamps, and each of the chosen weighting functions. **** Is it worth including the phi values for each combination of lamps and weighting functions as they are very similar? ---ZM ****
I think so. Can you transpose this table?---MKH ****
**** Also, can we use the data from a data frame to make this table?
It is risky to type in values. If our calculations change, we'll forget to change this table.
I can help with this process, if needed.  
In particular, there is an xtable function in R that will work nicely.---MKH}
