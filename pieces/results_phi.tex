% This table displays the exergy to energy factors for each lamp weighting function combination.

% \begin{table}
% \centering % Centered table
% \caption{Exergy to energy ratios for each of the selected lamps, and each of the chosen weighting functions. **** Is it worth including the phi values for each combination of lamps and weighting functions as they are very similar? ---ZM ****
% I think so. Can you transpose this table?---MKH ****
% **** Also, can we use the data from a data frame to make this table?
% It is risky to type in values. If our calculations change, we'll forget to change this table.
% I can help with this process, if needed.  
% In particular, there is an xtable function in R that will work nicely.---MKH}
