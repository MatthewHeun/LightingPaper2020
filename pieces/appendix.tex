% The appendix is an optional section that can contain 
% details and data supplemental to the main text. 
% For example, explanations of experimental details 
% that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but 
% nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; 
% figures of replicates for experiments 
% of which representative data is shown in the main text 
% can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. 
% Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

Radiant power; $\dot{Q}_{em}$ or $\dot{Q}_e$:

\begin{equation}
  \dot{Q}_{em} = \int \dot{Q}_{em, \lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

Other option; $\Phi_{e}$:

\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{e} = \int \Phi_{e, \lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

For the "wrong" radiant power and spectral radiant power as measured by the spectrometer we could use a ': $Q_{em}'$ or $\Phi_{e}'$; and $Q_{em, \lambda}'$ or $\Phi_{e, \lambda}'$.


Weighted radiant power $L_{f_\lambda}$, weighted by a weighting function $f_\lambda$:

\begin{equation}
  \dot{L}_{f_{\lambda}} = \int \dot{Q}_{em, \lambda} f_{\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \dot{L}_{V_{\lambda}} = \int \dot{Q}_{em, \lambda} V_{\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \dot{L}_{f_{univ, \lambda}} = \int \dot{Q}_{em, \lambda} f_{univ, \lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}


Luminous "flux" (or luminous "power") (in lm/Watt):

\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{v} = 683 lm/W \int \dot{Q}_{em, \lambda} V_{\lambda} \mathrm{d}\lambda \; .
\end{equation}


Regarding efficiencies (electricity to light, electricity to radiant power, and radiant power to light):

% All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. 
% In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', 
% e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
