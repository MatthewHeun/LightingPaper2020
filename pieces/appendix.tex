% The appendix is an optional section that can contain 
% details and data supplemental to the main text. 
% For example, explanations of experimental details 
% that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but 
% nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; 
% figures of replicates for experiments 
% of which representative data is shown in the main text 
% can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. 
% Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.
